            "The general principles include using optimal antibiotic dosing schemes, with attention to adverse effects, optimizing dosing and mode of administration by pathogen and indication, using therapeutic drug monitoring when available, prioritizing source control, and considering follow-up cultures in case of treatment failure to detect resistance development. Additionally, testing against new BLBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB resistant to all blactams, and selecting antibiotic treatment with the least resistant antibiotic/s based on MICs relative to the breakpoints is recommended for pan-resistant CR-GNB.",
            "Empirical antibiotic treatment is crucial in patients at high risk for CR-GNB infections, as it targets specific pathogens before pathogen identification, and a balance must be struck between achieving appropriate empirical therapy and conserving last resort therapies for these bacteria, with local guidelines guiding the empirical treatment phase based on local epidemiology.",

            "The level of certainty of evidence is low for colorectal surgery and very low for liver transplant surgery, but despite this, the panel suggests considering targeted PAP as a good practice for all solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to the high risk of infections and available evidence for liver transplant surgery.",
            "The studies suggest that CRE carriers have a higher rate of postoperative infections compared to non-carriers, with a significant association between pre-transplant CRE colonization and post-transplant CRE infections, as well as an increased risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by any type of bacteria and by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB).",

Additionally, testing against new BLBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB resistant to all blactams, and selecting antibiotic treatment with the least resistant antibiotic/s based on MICs relative to the breakpoints is recommended for pan-resistant CR-GNB.",

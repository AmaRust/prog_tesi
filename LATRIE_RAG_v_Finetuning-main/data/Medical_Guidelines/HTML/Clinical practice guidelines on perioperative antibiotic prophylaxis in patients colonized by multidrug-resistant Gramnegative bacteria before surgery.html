<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence-infections-in-escr-e-carriers-compared-with-noncarriers-">Review of the evidence Infections in ESCR-E carriers compared with noncarriers.</h4>
<p>Seven observational studies ( five prospective, two with medium and three with high risk of bias; one retrospective with high risk of bias; one prospective, multicenter, with low risk of bias), three including liver transplant recipients (IITR), showed an increased risk of postoperative infections in ESCR-E carriers compared with noncarriers (Table 2). Dubinsky-Perretoor et al. [29] included 3600 patients from three hospitals in Israel, Switzerland, and Serbia screened for ESCR-E before colorectal surgery and receiving cephalosporin-based PAP showing significantly higher SSIs in carriers compared with noncarriers (24.8% vs. 11.1%, P &lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis confirmed that ESCR-E carriers status was an independent predictor doubling the risk of SSIs (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.50-3.71), with even higher odds for SSIs caused by ESCR-E (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.70-10.56). Golzarri et al. [28] included 171 (30 ESCR-E carriers) patients with gastrointestinal and gynaecological malignancies reporting higher rates of SSIs (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.20-3.90) and bloodstream infections (RR 4.0, 95% CI 2.36-6.87) in carriers versus noncarriers, respectively. The sample size was limited, and carrier status was a risk factor for postoperative infections only at univariable analysis. Apisamthanarak et al. [30] included 129ESCR-E carriers among 360 patients undergoing abdominal surgery receiving various PAP, reporting ESCR-E colonization as a risk factor for SSIs (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.40, 95% CI 1.19-19.91); all ESCR-E SSIs occurred in ESCR-E carriers. Among LTR, Bert et al. [26] reported increased rates of ESCR-E colonization over time (from 0% in 2001-2003 to 11% in 2009-2010 in LTR). Logre et al. [32] enrolled 100 colonized LTR, reporting a sensitivity of 0.62 and a specificity 0.91 for pre-LT ESCR-E rectal carriage in predicting post-LT ESCR-E infections. Compared with other Enterobacterales, ESCR-<em>K. pneumoniae</em> carrier status was an independent predictor of ESCR-E infection.</p>
<p>The studies retrieved, involving mainly abdominal and liver transplant surgery, showed moderate or high risk of bias (only one multicentric study in colorectal surgery had low risk of bias) and reported an increased rate of postoperative infections and SSIs in ESCR-E carriers compared with noncarriers, suggesting that screening for carriers would define a population at risk that may be benefit of interventions to reduce postoperative infections.</p>

<p>We conditionally recommend targeted PAP in patients colonized with ESCR-E undergoing colorectal surgery (conditional recommendation for use, low certainty of evidence).</p>
<p>We conditionally recommend targeted PAP in patients colonized with ESCR-E undergoing liver transplant surgery (conditional recommendation for use, very low certainty of evidence).</p>
<p>It might be a good practice to consider targeted PAP for all SOT recipients who are colonized with ESCR-E before surgery (ungraded good practice statement).</p>
<p>Specific aspects of PAP in SOT recipients are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<h4 id="antimicrobial-stewardship-considerations">Antimicrobial stewardship considerations</h4>
<p>Regimens that may be used for targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers are listed in Table 3 according to the potential impact on antimicrobial resistance following the WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification [38,39] and considering the current indications for the treatment of MDR-GNB [40].</p>
<p>Under the consideration of antimicrobial stewardship, the use of carbapenems should be limited if other antibiotic options are available against ESCR-E. Reserve antibiotics that may be used for the treatment of extensively resistant bacteria, including novel molecules (e.g. ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazbactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, cefiderocol, imipenem-relebactam), should not be routinely used for targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers [40].</p>
<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h4>
<p><em>Targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers.</em> Two reports, including a prospective multinational study and a retrospective, single-centre study (with low and high risk of bias, respectively) analysed targeted PAP effectiveness in reducing postoperative infections [32,41]. Nutman et al. performed a multicenter, non-randomized, non-blinded interventional study involving three hospitals in Israel, Serbia, and Switzerland between 2012 and 2017 and including 3600 patients screened before elective colorectal surgery [41]. Of these, 14% (9%-29%) were ESCR-E carriers and 468 received either routine PAP with cefuroxime, or cefazolin, or ceftriaxome plus metronidazole (baseline phase) or etapenem (interventional phase). There was a sub-optimal adherence to the study phases, with 4% of patients receiving etapemen in the baseline phase, 20% receiving routine PAP in the interventional phase, and 1% receiving other or no antibiotics. Patients receiving routine PAP had higher National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) scores, while increased stoma creation was reported in the etapenem group. The multi-variable model (including NNIS score and stoma creation) showed a decreased SSIs risk of 33%, with a statistically significant difference favouring etapenem (adjusted risk difference, ARD -7.7%, 95% CI -14.6% to -0.8%). Moreover, SSIs caused by ESCR-E were significantly lower in the etapenem (0.9%) compared with the routine PAP group (6.5%, ARD -5.6%, 95% CI, -8.9% to -2.3%) showing an 86% reduction. The NNT to prevent one SSI among ESCR-E carriers was 13. The number needed to screen to prevent one SSI ranged from 45 to 138 by study site. The study was underpowered to detect the effect of the intervention on deep SSIs. No differences in mortality, <em>C. difficile</em> infection, acute renal failure, or intensive care unit (ICU) admission were detected between groups. Overall length of hospital stay and emergence of antibiotic resistance were not reported [41]. In a related, nested study from the same group including 225 patients at a single site, colonization by ESCR-E and CRE after surgery was significantly lower in the etapenem vs. the routine arm [42].</p>
<p>Logre et al. [32] retrospectively analysed 100 ESCR-E colonized LTR in France. A total of 35 postoperative infections caused by ESCR-E (11 SSIs, 10 urinary tract infections, nine pulmonary infections, and five sepsis) were reported at day 30. Only 68 patients could be assessed according to PAP, showing higher rates of ESCR-E postoperative infections among LTR receiving routine (7/11, 63%) compared with targeted (17/57, 30%) PAP (P= 0.04). Targeted PAP included cefoxitin (40%), a carbapenem (31%), or piperacillin/tazbactam (29%). Although the results favoured targeted PAP, the quality of the study was low, with high risk of bias because of the retrospective nature, the limited sample size (with only 11 patients receiving routine prophylaxis), and the lack of outcome according to each regimen. Mortality rates between infected and noninfected patients at day 28 and 90 were similar, while ICU stay was longer in infected versus noninfected patients (P &lt; 0.001). Hospital length of stay and PAP-associated adverse effects or antibiotic resistance were not reported [32].</p>
<p>Other two reports on targeted PAP were analysed but showed major limitations. Apisarnthanarak et al. [30] reported no association between the use of carbapenem-based PAP, received by 23% of carriers and 6% of noncarriers, and SSIs reduction (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.55-14.24); however, no comparison with other PAP was provided. De Patena et al. [31] performed an interventional non-randomized prospective study in 76 ESCR-E carriers undergoing pancreatic surgery, comparing postoperative infections in patients receiving PAP with ampicillin/sulbactam (period 1) or piperacillin/tazbactam (period 2). Although significantly higher rates of postoperative infections (30% versus 11%, P= 0.025) and superficial SSIs (34% versus 0, P &lt; 0.001) were shown in period 1 versus 2, PAP was not selected according to preoperative cultures, and prolonged PAP (up to 3 days) was allowed during period 1 in case of biliary stent placement [31].</p>
<p>Given the paucity of data and the observational study design, there was a low (for colorectal surgery) to very low (for liver transplant surgery) certainty of evidence supporting targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers. Owing to the high risk for infections in SOT recipients and the evidence for liver transplant surgery, the panel believes it may be a good practice to consider targeted PAP for all SOT.</p>
<h4 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h4>
<p>Owing to the very low evidence for targeted PAP effectiveness in ESCR-E carriers undergoing liver transplantation and the lack of evidence for other transplant surgeries, further studies are needed to investigate the impact of targeted PAP in reducing post transplant infections among ESCR-E colonized SOT candidates. Research protocols should include the postsurgical monitoring of antibiotic resistance (e.g. CRE colonization through rectal cultures, especially if carbapenem-based PAP is used) and report antimicrobial susceptibility according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (<a href="https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/">https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/</a>) results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the limited evidence on the effectiveness of targeted PAP in other specific surgical groups, the panel suggests designing clinical trials in ESCR-E carriers undergoing high-risk surgical procedures (e.g. major cardiothoracic surgery, pancreatic surgery, major oncologic general surgery or gynecologic surgery). The trial design should consider the local burden of ESCR-E and patient-related risk factors for carrier status (e.g. previous ESCR-E infections, recent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, previous hospital or long-term care facility admission or prolonged stay, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, renal failure). Postsurgical monitoring of resistance development to the antibiotics used for targeted regimens is recommended. Same-strain colonization and infection relatedness, as well as the mechanisms of resistance of newly isolated MDR-GNB detected after surgery, should be investigated.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h4>
<p><em>Infections in CRE carriers versus noncarriers.</em> Four observational studies (two retrospective, with high and medium risk of bias and two prospective, with medium risk of bias), all including LTR, three performed in Italy and one in Brazil, compared the rates of postoperative infections between CRE carriers and noncarriers (Table 2) [12,13,33,34]. Mazza et al. [12] identified 10 out of 310 (3%) patients who CRKP carriers before LT; 30% developed CRKP infections documented up to 70 days post-LT with a mortality of 100%. Pretransplant colonization was significantly associated with infection (OR 10.76, 95% CI 2.60(-)44) but was detected only by univariable analysis. Giannella et al. [33] performed a prospective, single-centre study analysing 237 LTR and 10 (4%) CRKP carriers, showing lower rates of post-LT infections in non-colonized versus CRKP colonized within 120 days after LT (2% versus 18% respectively, P &lt; 0.001) [33]. The same transplant centre included 553 LTR between 2010 and 2017 showing that CRE colonization increased significantly over time (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05(-)1.39) [34]. Multivariable analysis identified CRE colonization before transplantation as an independent risk for CRE infection (HR 18.50, 95% CI 6.76(-)50.54). Freire et al. reported 72 (40%) CRKP carriers among 181 LTR; 42% became CRKP infected compared with one out of 139 noncarriers [43]. CRKP carriers were more likely to develop an infection caused by CRKP compared with those who were colonized by other MDR-GNB (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.04-1.58). The study, however, combined pre- and post-transplant colonization. The same authors performed a study enrolling 98 (13%) LTR who were CRE carriers, showing higher rates of CRE SSIs in carriers versus noncarriers (P(=) 0.001) [13]. CRE acquisition before transplantation was identified as an independent risk factor for SSIs caused by any type of bacteria (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.43-3.77) and by MDR-GNB (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.46-6.89). Although these studies highlight an increased rate of postoperative infections among CRE carriers vs. noncarriers, several limitations were detected, including the study design (all observational single-site studies, retrospective in two cases) and the variable, or not reported, follow-up time for infection detection (Table 2).</p>

<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h4>
<p><em>Targeted PAP in CRE carriers.</em> Two retrospective studies, a Brazilian single-centre study and a multicentric study performed in the US and Brazil (with moderate and high risk of bias, respectively) were retrieved [13,44]. In a cohort of 762 LTR enrolled between 2010-2018, PAP was changed from 2014 replacing cefotaxime with amikacin (in association with ampicillin) if an increased risk of developing MDR infections (e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci, CRAB, and CRE) was documented [13]. Risk factors included pretransplant CRE colonization, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the past 30 days, need of dialysis, or MELD &gt;24. A total of 229 (30%) SSIs were detected, including 109 caused by MDR bacteria. When targeted PAP was performed, the rates of SSIs caused by any MDR bacteria decreased to 13% (14/109) compared with 30% (25/120) of those caused by nonresistant bacteria (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.80). The study, however, was limited by the lack of susceptibility profiles for MDR bacteria receiving targeted PAP and by the lack of data for CRE infections, therefore the efficacy of the modified PAP could not be clearly assessed [13]. Taimur et al. [44] included 60 SOT recipients (50% liver, 28% heart, and 12% kidney transplant recipients) with either previous CRE infection or carrier status. Post-transplant CRE infections were documented in 40% of cases, and 35% SOT recipients received targeted PAP for CRE. Targeted PAP, however, was not known for most patients and mainly consisted of a combination of 2 to 3 agents such as carbapenems, polymyxin, and tigecyline. At univariable analysis, targeted PAP was more commonly reported in patients with post-SOT CRE infections (13/24, 54%) compared with those without CRE infections (8/36, 22%, P(=) 0.015). Studylimitations included the small sample size and the associated impossibility to perform a multivariable analysis. Furthermore, data on CRE colonization could not be dissected from previous CRE infection, and most patients on targeted prophylaxis had prior CRE bacteremia [44]. None of the studies provided data on adverse events or emergence of antibiotic resistance following targeted PAP. No conclusions could be drawn from these studies on the effects of targeted PAP in CRE carriers undergoing transplant surgery.</p>
<h3 id="antimicrobial-stewardship-considerations">Antimicrobial stewardship considerations</h3>
<p>Although there is no evidence for recommending targeted PAP for CRE carriers, the knowledge of CRE colonization in high-risk patients, such as those receiving transplant surgery, is relevant not only for infection control purposes but also for the adaption of postsurgical empirical treatment, for example in case of severe infections [45].</p>
<h3 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h3>
<p>The panel recommends designing clinical trials to assess the impact of CRE rectal screening in high-risk surgeries. A recommendation is made also to design trials of targeted PAP in CRE carriers undergoing SOT and other high-risk surgical procedures to evaluate the effectiveness, applicability, and safety of the intervention following antimicrobial stewardship principles, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>clinical trials of targeted PAP should be designed considering rectal culture results</li>
<li>the choice of targeted PAP should take into consideration the limited number of options that are available for the treatment of CRE infections, avoiding novel compounds that may be required for the treatment of postsurgical infections</li>
<li>Resistance monitoring should be performed through detection of MDR-CNB carriage after surgery and to detect emerging resistance to the regimens used for targeted PAP. In SSIs, the clonal relationship between MDR bacteria detected after surgery and preoperative colonizing bacteria should be determined, and both short- and long-term postsurgical colonization investigated.</li>

<p><em>Infections in CRAB carriers versus noncarriers.</em> Only two cohort studies (one prospective and one retrospective with medium and high risk of bias, respectively), performed at the same transplant centre in Brazil, assessed CRAB postoperative infections among LTR [13,35] showing increased infection risk in carriers vs. noncarriers (Table 2). In the first study, 24 CRAB carriers were identified among 196 LTR [35]. Post-LT infections caused by CRAB were detected in 56 (29%) LTR and associated with 60-day mortality (P &lt; 0.001). Pre-transplant colonization was predictive of post-LT CRAB infection (relative risk, RR, 1.48, 95% CI 0.96-2.26) and mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.99-126) but was confirmed only by univariable analysis. In 7/1 carriers developing CRAB infections, pre-LT and post-LT strains appeared closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis [35]. The second study reported pretransplant CRAB colonization in 28 out of 762 (4%) LTR with occurrence of CRAB SSIs in 31 (10%) patients. The rates of CRAB SSIs were significantly higher among CRAB carriers versus noncarriers (P= 0.001) [13].</p>

<p>Due to the limited evidence that CRAB colonization before surgery increases the risk of postoperative CRAB infections, the panel suggests designing clinical trials comparing the incidence risk of CRAB infections in carriers versus noncarriers, especially for patients undergoing high-risk surgery.

<h2 id="4-timing-for-preoperative-mdr-gnb-screening">4 Timing for preoperative MDR-GNB screening</h2>
<p>Question 4. When should we perform the screening for MDR-GNB before surgery?</p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
<p>For MDR-GNB screening, cultures performed within 3 weeks prior to surgery may be considered (ungraded good practice statement).</p>
<h3 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h3>
<p>There were no studies evaluating the incidence of SSIs or other clinical outcomes according to the timing of preoperative screening. In the retrieved studies, rectal screening to detect MDR-GNB carriage was usually performed starting from 2 to 3 weeks before surgery until the day of surgery, while some reports did not specify the timing for preoperative screening (Table 2). Colonization remains a dynamic process with long-term persistence of MDR-GNB carriage status that may occur in patients discharged by hospitals and those undergoing surgery, including SOT [47,48]. Data favoring targeted PAP based on the results of cultures taken more than 3 weeks before surgery were not retrieved.</p>
<h3 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h3>
<p>Studies analyzing the optimal timing for preoperative screening should be performed. Further research should evaluate the benefits of additional screening before surgery in case of recent antibiotic treatment.</p>
<h2 id="5-duration-of-pap-in-mdr-gnb-carriers">5 Duration of PAP in MDR-GNB carriers</h2>
<p>Question 5. Should the duration of PAP change in patients colonized with MDR-GNB before surgery?</p>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>
<p>PAP should be discontinued within 24 hours after surgery in patients colonized with MDR-GNB (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).</p>
<p>In transplant surgery other than renal transplant, the extension of PAP duration to 48-72 hours may be considered according to the type of transplant (ungraded good practice statement).</p>
<h3 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h3>
<p>Since PAP aims to achieve adequate tissue levels prior and during surgery to minimize SSIs, a single dose of preoperative PAP is recommended for most surgical procedures [5]. In colonized patients, we either reported no clear evidence for changing the usual PAP (Table 1) or provided conditional recommendation to administer PAP regimens (that are already established according to international guidelines) according to the results of preoperative cultures (Table 3). Therefore, the duration of targeted PAP should align with current recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/ASHP/SIS/SHEA) as well as other international societies that consistently give indication for PAP discontinuation within 24 hours after surgery [3,54,49,50,51,52,53,54]. No additional dosing is usually recommended for intravascular lines and devices, surgical drains, or stent placement [5,55,56]. The certainty of evidence supporting the benefits of limiting the duration of PAP to 24 hours is moderate mainly because of the high heterogeneity of studies performed in different types of surgery. The use of prolonged PAP (&gt;24-48 hours post-inclusion) has been associated with an increased risk of antibiotic resistance, acute kidney injury, and <em>C. difficile</em> infection in observational studies while conferring no apparent decrease in SSIs, as shown by a meta-analysis including only RCTs and by a recent cluster randomized trial in clean orthopaedic surgery [57, 58, 59, 60]. A meta-analysis on the optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery showed that PAP &gt;24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing thermal SSIs than shorter PAP, however the conclusions were hampered by the high heterogeneity and risk of bias of the included studies [61].</p>
<p>In transplant surgery there is currently no formal consensus on PAP duration due to a lack of comparative trials; recommendations based on expert opinion suggest the administration of PAP for &lt;24 hours in kidney, 24-48 hours in liver, heart, pancreas, and for 48-72 hours in intestinal/multivisceral and lung transplantation [5,18,62]. Exceptions are represented by procedures that may require prolonged treatment (e.g. lung recipients with respiratory colonization or infection and intestinal or multivisceral transplant with infected mesh or fistulas) [18,62].</p>
<p>Since the optimal duration of targeted PAP in MDR-GNB carriers should follow the same principles of PAP to minimize the risks associated with prolonged antibiotic administration, the recommendation is based on the abovementioned studies that do not specifically report the carrier status.</p>
<h3 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h3>
<p>Further research should be performed to investigate the clinical impact of shorter versus longer PAP in patients undergoing transplant surgery.</p>
<h2 id="6-specific-aspects-of-mdr-gnb-carriage-in-sot-recipients">6 Specific aspects of MDR-GNB carriage in SOT recipients</h2>
<p>SOT recipients are exposed to MDR-GNB infections due to prolonged hospitalization, invasive procedures, ICU admission, and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment [63,64]. SSIs are a common issue and may occur in 3% to 53% of SOT recipients, with highest rates observed for intestinal, liver, and pancreas transplantation [62]. LTR can develop intra-abdominal infections especially in the early post-LT period. In this group, the risk of ESC-ER and CRKP infections range from 6% to 13% and 3% and 10%, respectively, depending on the geographic area [65, 66, 67]. ESCR-E infections are common, accounting for up to 75% of MDR-GNB isolates in SOT recipients [67]. Among nonfermenters, rates of CRAB and MDR PA up to 63% and 52%, respectively, were reported in bloodstream infections (BSIs) [66,68,69]. Post-SOT infections caused by MDR-GNB are associated with higher mortality compared with their susceptible counterpart [26,62,65,70,71,72,73].</p>
<p>The American Society of Transplantation (AST) recommendations for MDR-GNB management and the Spanish Transplantation Infection Study Group (GESITRA) guidelines acknowledge that early detection of MDR-GNB carriers is useful to inform contact precaution in SOT candidates and may be taken into consideration when treating postoperative infections [45,74]. Nevertheless, in asymptomatic SOT patients, non-outbreak settings, or in regions of endemicity the benefits of ESCR-E active surveillance are questioned [18,74]. New emerging evidence, however, showed increased rates of post-LT infections among ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB carriers before SOT [26,13,14,32,33,34,35]. Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) who were ESCR-E carriers had more frequently post-KT urinary tract infections (UTs) versus noncarriers [75]. Limited data are available for XDRPA colonization and occurrence of post-SOT infections. One prospective study in LTR showed that, out of 69 (38%) who were MDR-GNB carriers, 27% XDRPA carriers compared with 2% noncarriers developed postoperative XDRPA infections; however, most patients included in the study became colonized after LT [43], Colonization of non-CI sites, such as respiratory colonization by XDRPA in lung recipients, CRAB skin or multisite colonization inLT, or pretransplant bacteriuria in KTR may be relevant to target PAP, but data remain limited [18, 43, 46, 62, 76].</p>
<p>PAP regimens and duration vary across transplant centres and are often customized to suit unique SSIs risks factors and surgical scenarios [18, 62, 77]. A worldwide survey involving lung transplant specialists reported that 67% of prescribers performed targeted PAP based on pretransplant MDR-GNB sputum colonization [76]. The AST guidelines for SSIs prevention recommend different PAP according to the type of SOT (with broader coverage for intestinal/multivisceral transplantation, lung transplantation, and delayed chest closure) and to adjust PAP in case of ongoing infections, with most recommendations being weak, with low quality evidence [18]. Targeted PAP in ESCR-E or CRE SOT carriers remains undefined, and recipient screening is recommended for lung transplant [74]. Although GESITRA recommended that ESCR-E colonized patients receive targeted PAP, no indication was given for a preferred regimen among beta-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, aminol glycosides, or carbapenems [45]. Ertapenem was mentioned as an acceptable alternative in selected ESCR-E carriers, with a recommendation to limit carbapenem-based PAP due to the risk of carbapenemases production. For CRE carriers, targeted PAP was not recommended except for centres reporting a high incidence of CRE SSIs, however a cut-off value was not provided [45]. Data comparing PAP regimens in SOT remain scarce. A study including B1S KTR found a significant reduction in SSIs when amikican was used in PAP instead of a cephalosporin [78]. Although this result could be explained by the predominance of ESCR-E SSIs, data on preoperative carriage status were not provided [78]. As previously reported, two recent retrospective studies with moderate and high risk of bias showed conflicting results on the benefit of targeted PAP in CRE carriers undergoing SOT [13, 44].</p>
<h3 id="recommendations-and-future-research">Recommendations and future research</h3>
<p>Recommendations for SOT recipients who are carriers of MDR-GNB before surgery are summarized in Table 1. Indications for future trials in ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB carriers undergoing SOT are reported in the related sections. Moreover, future research is recommended for XDRPA screening to assess the risk of post-SOT infections among carriers. MDR-GNB multisite screening vs. rectal screening only should also be considered in SOT recipients before surgery to evaluate the impact on post-SOT infections according to the type of organ transplanted. Although these guidelines did not address postoperative colonization, the association between post-transplant MDR-GNB colonization and infections has often been documented, suggesting that culture surveillance should be considered also after SOT, according to the local epidemiology and individual risk factors [13, 34, 43, 48, 70, 79].</p>

<p>Targeted PAP has been predominantly studied in transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) among fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR)-E carriers due to the type of surgical approach (that involves entering the gastrointestinal tract) and the increased rates of FQR-E colonization reported before TRUSPB.</p>

<p>We suggest the use of targeted PAP for patients who are colonized with FQR-E before TRUSPB (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).</p>
<h3 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h3>
<p><em>Fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR)-E in TRUSPB.</em> Infectious complications (e.g. UTIs, acute prostatitis, BSIs, sepsis) following TRUSPB occur in 1% to 5% of patients [80, 81]. FQ are broadly prescribed for PAP due to the IV/oral administration and the high penetration into prostate tissues [82]. FQR-E rectal carriage has increased, showing rates exceeding 20% in certain areas, and was associated with alarming rates of post-TRUSPB infectious complications [83, 84, 85, 86, 87]. Bratzler et al. [5] suggest that local resistance patterns to fluoroquinolones, particularly with <em>E. coli</em>, should be evaluated to help guiding PAP selection.</p>
<p>The retrieved studies reporting infectious complications and PAP in FQR-GNB carriers receiving TRUSPB are reported in Appendix S2. The use of entrapment, cefoxitin, and fosfomycin in PAP was associated to reduced incidence of BSIs in FQR-E carriers undergoing TRUSPB [88, 89, 86]. Data on TRUSPB PAP, however, are limited by a high variability in the regimens used and the short follow-up to assess infectious complications. Two single-centre observational studies performed in the US and Korea favoured targeted vs. routine PAP [90, 91]. Suwantarat et al. [90] included 44 FQR-<em>E. coli</em> carriers (22% of screened patients); of these, 43% among those receiving an oral cephalosporin plus ciprofloxacin developed post-TRUSBP infections compared to none receiving targeted PAP (61% with cotrimoxazole). Dai et al. [91] included 314 patients and 12% FQR-GNB carriers; of these, 36 (11%) received targeted PAP (69% corrimoxazole, 56% in combination with intramuscular gentamicin) versus oral ciprofloxacin. Targeted PAP was associated with decreased odds of post-TRUSPB infections (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.20-2.50). Bloomfield et al. [92] used etapenem-based PAP in 326 patients; of these, 6% and 9% were colonized with ESCR-E and FQR-E, respectively [92]. Three (1%) episodes of post-TRUSPB sepsis were reported. Although we excluded single articles referring exclusively to ambulatory TRUSBP, data from comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses were reviewed. Cussans et al. included nine observational studies and 4571 patients (23% colonized by FQR-GNB) comparing FQ-based with targeted PAP; post-TRUSPB infections were 4.6% versus 0.7%, respectively [93]. The NNT to prevent one post-TRUSPB infection was 27. Scott et al. [94] performed a meta-analysis of 15 articles up to March 2017 including two controlled trials and 13,320 patients. Post-TRUSPB infections were 3.4% versus 0.8% with an estimated risk difference of 2.6% for FQ-based versus targeted PAP. The NNT to prevent one post-TRUSPB infection was 39. No optimal targeted PAP for carriers was identified.</p>
<p>To date, the superiority of prolonged (e.g. 48-72 hours) or multiple-dose treatment versus short-course (24 hours) or single-dose PAP has not been demonstrated [82]. Some studies showed that PAP with &gt;=2 antibiotics caused the reduction of post-TRUSPB UTIs, but these results were not confirmed in clinical trials using targeted PAP [95, 96]. Other studies reported no benefits in the addition of aminoglycosides to FQ [97, 98].</p>
<p>A recently published (therefore not formally included in the evidence review) randomized, non-blinded, multicenter trial including 1288 patients undergoing TRUSPB (15.8% FQR carriers) and comparing ciprofloxacin PAP versus culture-based PAP showeda risk reduction of -1.8% (95% CI -0.004 to 0.040) in the 7-day post-TRUSPB infection rate. FQR carriers had a 6.2-fold higher risk of early postbiopsy infection compared to noncarriers [99].</p>
<p>The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines pose a weak recommendation for the use of targeted PAP in TRUSPB, indicating fosfomycin trometamid, cephalosporin, and aminoglycoside as alternatives to FQ without addressing specific MDR-GNB [100]. The EAU strongly recommends considering the trans-perinecal approach for prostate biopsy due to the lower risk of infectious complications. Furthermore, a recent RCT performed in Norway enrolling 792 patients performing transperinecal prostate biopsy reported that PAP may be omitted in this population since infections were not significantly higher in patients receiving and not receiving PAP [101].</p>
<h4 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h4>
<p>Further studies are recommended to understand the impact of colonization with MDR-GNB other than FQR-E on post-TRUSPB infections. High-quality trials are suggested to assess the efficacy of specific PAP regimens in FQR-E carriers undergoing TRUSPB. A recommendation for research is made to design trials of targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers, especially in areas with increased ESCR-E burden. Future trials should include adequate monitoring of infectious complications and development of antibiotic resistance following surgery.</p>

<p>Question 7.3 Should screening be performed and PAP modified for patients colonized with MDR-GNB before urologic surgery?</p>
<h4 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h4>
<p>Insufficient evidence is available at this time to recommend for or against screening to inform targeted PAP for patients who are colonized with MDR-GNB before urologic surgery (no recommendation).</p>
<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h4>
<p>There is limited evidence on the impact of targeted PAP on infectious complications following urologic surgery in MDR-GNB carriers. Rectal colonization may not be informative, while urinary cultures are often obtained to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria before surgery, as recommended by clinical practice guidelines [51,102]. The 2019 American Urological Association (AUA) best practice guidelines report a high variability in prescribing PAP patterns for most urologic interventions [51]. Although targeted PAP is not routinely recommended, the AUA guidelines suggest that, if PAP is required and a known history of MDR organisms is reported, an expanded antimicrobial coverage should be warranted [51]. The EAU guidelines suggest that the identification of asymptomatic bacteriuria through urine culture before surgery aims to reduce the risk of infectious complications and to optimize antimicrobial coverage before invasive urological procedures, but do not provide recommendations on targeted PAP due to the high geographic variability in type of bacteria, susceptibility patterns, and availability of antibiotics [100].</p>
<p>Higher rates of postoperative infections were reported among patients with urinary colonization compared with noncolonized ones, and patients undergoing urologic surgery often have risk factors for MDR-GNB acquisition (e.g. previous surgical procedures, permanent bladder catheters, double J stents, etc.) [103,104]. Nevertheless, studies comparing postoperative infections in MDR-GNB urinary carriers versus noncarriers are lacking. A small, prospective single-centre study included 75 patients undergoing urologic surgery and receiving PAP based on the results of urine cultures (from day 2 before surgery until withdrawal of bladder catheter or until day 7) [105]. Sixteen (22%) ESCR-E carriers received targeted PAP mainly with aminoglycosides (63%), cefoxitin (19%), and imipenem (13%). Eleven (15%) postoperative infections, mainly SSIs, were detected in patients receiving targeted PAP compared with 5% in noncolonized ones (P= 0.028). A total of 31% ESCR-E carriers developed postoperative infections; 80% of these were caused by the same colonizing strain compared to 9% in noncarriers [105].</p>
<h4 id="research-and-conditional-use-in-restricted-trials">Research and conditional use in restricted trials</h4>
<p>In urologic surgery other than TRUSPB, further research is needed to identify the impact of MDR-GNB colonization and targeted PAP based on preoperative cultures, including urinary cultures, on postoperative infections. Furthermore, the optimal targeted PAP for different MDR-GNB should be investigated according to the type of urological procedure and the local rates of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-of-the-evidence-and-research-needs">Limitations of the evidence and research needs</h4>
<p>Our review has identified important knowledge gaps and limitations, including retrospective study designs, small sample sizes, lack of assessment of key outcomes, and a wide heterogeneity of surgical settings, types of PAP, and timing of assessment of postoperative infections from surgery. Most questions were addressed by observational studies with high risk of bias (Table 2 and Tables S1 and S2). Well-done RCTs are highly needed to fill in existing gaps and to improve patients&#39; outcomes.</p>
<p>For ESCR-E and CRE carriers, increased evidence recently highlighted the association between rectal colonization and postoperative infections, supporting surveillance screening for MDR-GNB, especially in areas with high burden and for high-risk surgery, suggesting that targeted PAP may be effective in reducing SSIs. No RCTs, however, were performed comparing targeted with routine PAP in MDR-GNB carriers. Furthermore, routine prophylaxis may vary according to local protocols and different geographic areas, potentially impacting SSIs. One prospective multinational study showed a potential benefit for etapenem use in ESCR-E carriers undergoing colorectal surgery [41]. Previously, etapenem-based PAP was used in studies not reporting colonization data, showing SSIs reduction in a retrospective study including 615 cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery [106], while a RCT including 499 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery reported similar efficacy for etapenem versus routine PAP [107]. Because of the limited options currently available to effectively treat MDR-GNB, well-designed studies exploring optimal PAP are needed. These trials should investigate the impact of targeted PAP on microbiological, epidemiological, and clinical outcomes as well as development of resistance to the antibiotics used for targeted regimens. Antibiotic type and dosing should be chosen according to PK/PD principles and considering the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Few studies have explored the impact of carrier status for MDR-GNB other than ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB. XDRPA as well as PDR-GNB colonization effects on SSIs need further attention, as colonization rates by these bacteria are likely to increase in the future. If PAP including antibiotic combinations (e.g. two or more antibiotics with <em>in vitro</em> efficacy against MDR-GNB) are investigated, efforts should be made to analyse their potential for resistance selection and side effects.</p>
<p>Other antibiotic-based interventions for reducing postsurgical infections (e.g. decolonization, SDD) and targeting MDR-GNB carriers before surgery have not been explored in clinical trials. The ENTHERE study group performed an open-label, multicenter RCT treating 53 SOI recipients who were MDR-GNB carriers with oral colistin plus neomycin, while 52 did not receive the decontamination protocol. No significant difference in infections due to MDR Enterobacterales was observed between groups, however patients enrolled were colonized not only before (58%) but also after SOT (42%) [108], SDD with oral colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B was performed in a RCT in colorectal surgery showing a reduction of postoperative infections in the SDD arm compared to controls, nevertheless carrier status was not tested [109]. Since recent trials in colorectal surgery showed that the use of oral antibiotics (with or without mechanical bowel preparation) may reduce the risk of SSIs, protocols exploring the use of oral therapy with activity on MDR-GNB should be considered [110,111]. While coordinated actions (e.g., decolonization, active surveillance, and stewardship measures) seemed to contribute to SSIs reduction for MDR Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, no bundles complementing PAP in MDR-GNB carriers undergoing surgery were found [112]. Metagenomic studies assessing the effect of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota composition and on patients&#39; colonization dynamics over time should be investigated within new protocols or bundled interventions targeting MDR-GNB.</p>
<p>The reduction of SSIs requires a comprehensive approach in terms of antibiotic-based interventions and best surgical practices (e.g. minimization of surgical operative time, regulation of glucose and temperature, optimization of sterile techniques, and management of patient comorbidities) [49,59,113]. The optimization of antibiotic-based interventions should focus not only on targeted PAP but also on heightening stewardship initiatives to monitor and contain the consequences of new prescription patterns, enhance surveillance protocols, improve local adherence to guidelines, and promote a multidisciplinary approach to target SSIs [114].</p>

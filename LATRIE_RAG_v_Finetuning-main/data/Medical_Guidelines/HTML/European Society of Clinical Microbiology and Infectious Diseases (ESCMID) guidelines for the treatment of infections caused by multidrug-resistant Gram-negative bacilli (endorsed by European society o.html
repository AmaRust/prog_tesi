<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
<li>For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (<strong>strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>/<strong>good practice statement</strong>). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
<li>For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active <em>in vitro</em>, for short durations of therapy (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>), or intravenous foafymycin (<strong>strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
<li>We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (<strong>strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
<li>We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (<strong>conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h4>
<p>The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype. The main comparison is between the older BLBII (amoxicillin- clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapemens and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.</p>
<p>The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.</p>
<h4 id="bloodstream-infections">Bloodstream infections</h4>
<p><em>BLBLI versus carbapenems.</em> The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em>[16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI -o to 14.5%). The risk difference was lower in the subgroup of patients with UTI (RD 3.7%, -o to 10.7%) than among patients with other sources of BSI (RD 14.1%, -o to 24.5%). Following the trial, the authors found a high rate of false susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam among OXA-1 producers with automatic methods or strip-gradient tests performed in the trial sites. A further analysis of the trial excluded patients with BSI caused by non-susceptible strains (piperacillin-tazobactam MIC &gt;16 mg/L; meropenem MIC &gt;1 mg/L CLI, or MIC &gt;2 mg/L EUCAST), as assessed by broth microlithion in a reference laboratory [20] The difference between groups decreased and was non-significant with a smaller sample size, mortality 13/134 (9.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 6/149 (4%) with meropenem, risk difference 5.7% (95% CI -1% to 11%). The certainty from this trial showing advantage of meropenem compared with piperacillin-tazobactam was classified as moderate, due to differences related to the high rate of OXA-1-producers with high MICs to piperacillin-tazobactam and to the small sample size of the further subgroup analyses. The MERINO-2 was a pilot RCT comparing piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem among patients with BSI caused by presumed Amp-C b-lactamase-producing but third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae spp., <em>Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia</em> spp., <em>Klebsiella aerogenes</em> or <em>Seratia marcescens</em>[21]. Among 70 included patients, mortality was very low (two patients in the meropenem arm) and there was no significant difference in clinical failure (8/38, 21% with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 4/34, 12% with meropenem).</p>
<p>A large number of observational studies compared carbapenem therapy with old BLBII for the therapy of 3GCephRE BSI (20 studies, Table 3) [22-41], Empirical and targeted therapies were assessed in about half of the studies each, and all reported on mortality,</p>
<p>[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]</p>
<p>variably reporting also secondary outcomes. The largest study included 365 patients for the empirical treatment and 601 patients for targeted treatment [22], but most included a few dozen patients (Table 3). None of the studies showed a significant difference between groups, except for a small study at high risk of bias showing higher unadjusted mortality with BLBI including all Enterobacterales [41]. None of the studies were at low risk of bias; 13 were classified at moderate risk, when using an adjusted analysis with a minimal sample size allowing some adjustment and seven at high risk, mostly reporting crude associations. Hence, there is a large bulk of observational, real-life, data showing no differences in mortality and other outcomes between BLBI and carbenemens for the treatment for 3GCphRE BSI. These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection. Different susceptibility testing methods and definitions of 3GCphRE were used in different studies. The overall certainty of the evidence for the lack of advantage for carbenemens from observational studies was judged as low for low-risk BSI, and very low for high-risk BSI.</p>
<p><em>Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems and BLBI versus non-BLBI.</em> Nine retrospective observational studies compared carbapenems with any other non-carbapenem antibiotic (carbapenem-sparing regimen); two addressed empirical treatments and all but one analysed the targeted treatment phase [30,42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. The carbapenem-sparing regimens included mainly BLBI, quinolones and aminoglycosides. Four studies reported an adjusted association and none of these found a significant outcome difference between carbapenems and non-carbapenems, but the sample sizes were small and residual differences between groups remained despite adjustment (moderate-risk to high-risk bias) [43, 47, 48, 49]. Odds ratios for mortality tended in favour of carbapenems in two studies [43, 49], clinical failure was in favour of non-intravenous carbapenems-sparing antibiotics in one [47] and in the largest study (249 patients receiving empirical carbapenems compared with 86 patients receiving mainly aminoglycosides), there was no significant difference between groups with respect to mortality and clinical failure [48].</p>
<p>Three studies compared old BLBI with a comparator regimen [27, 42, 46]. A single study using propensity score matching showed numerically better outcomes with a carbapenem or cefepine compared with piperacillin-tazobactam as targeted treatment for AmpC-b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, but with a small sample and no statistically significant difference between groups [27]. All studies were at high risk of bias precluding inferences for this comparison.</p>
<p>This is a small body of observational evidence further supporting no significant advantage to carbapenems in the real-life treatment of 3GCphRE BSI, but the certainty of this evidence is very low.</p>
<p><em>Ertapenem versus imipenem/meropenem.</em> Four observational studies [50, 51, 52, 53] and one small RCT [54] compared etrapenem with imipenem or meropenem, mostly as targeted therapy for BSI caused by any Enterobacteriaceae. The studies included BSI of different sources, with UTI comprising 40%-47% of the patients in all studies. The RCT included also non-bacterameric infections and found significantly lower mortality with etrapenem [54]. The other studies did not find a significant difference between the different carbapenems. Although most reported an adjusted analysis, the risk of bias was moderate to high because there was a large difference between groups at baseline, with etrapenem used for less severe infections or prescribed as de-escalation therapy after clinical improvement in studies evaluating targeted therapy. The overall certainty of the evidence showing similar or better outcomes for etrapenem and impienem/meropenem for 3GCephRE BSI was moderate.</p>
<p><em>Cephamycins and cefepime.</em> Cephamycins may be active against ESL-producing 3GcephRE. Five retrospective observational cohort studies evaluated cefmetazole or flomoxel versus carbapenems for 3GCephRE BSI (27 to 389 patients per study) [55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. All evaluated mortality. In the largest study including 389 patients, overall, no association was found between targeted flomoxel therapy and mortality; but when flomoxel&#39;s MIC were elevated within the susceptible range (2-8 mg/L), flomoxel was associated with mortality compared with carbapenems (adjusted OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.9-16.8) [57]. Another small study of 42 patients with dialysis access-related ESBL-<em>Klebsiella</em> spp. BSI showed higher mortality with targeted flomoxel compared with carbapenems, but most patients did not receive <em>in vitro</em> covering therapy in the first 5 days and appropriate adjustment was not possible considering the sample size [56]. The overall certainty of the evidence for a possible advantage of carbapenems over cephamycins was very low.</p>
<p>Cefepime may be active against AmpC-producing 3GcephRE. Seven retrospective observational cohort studies evaluated cefepime versus carbapenems [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65] or a non-cefepime regimen [43]. Variation in results depending on resistance mechanism was found, with higher mortality sometimes reported with cefepime for ESBL infections and no difference in outcomes in studies specifically addressing AmpC producers. Two studies from the same group in Taiwan found an association between cefepime treatment and mortality [60,63]. In a study including 144 patients with cephalosporin-resistant <em>Enterobacter</em> spp. infections, overall there was no significant association, but in a very small subgroup of patients with higher cefepime MIC in the susceptible dose-dependent category, mortality was higher with cefepime (5 of 7 versus 2 of 11, p 0.045) [63]. In a study of 178 patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales BSI, definitive treatment with cefepime administered only to 17 patients was associated with higher mortality both in multivariate analysis and a propensity-score matched analysis [60]. The other studies were smaller and found no significant difference between cefepime and carbapenems or comparator antibiotics. Most studies were at high risk of bias and, considering serious inconsistency, there was very low certainty of evidence for no difference between cefepime and carbapenems or inferiority of cefepime with high MIC compared with carbapenems.</p>
<p><em>Other antibiotics.</em> Quinolones were examined individually [42,66,67] or as part of a general comparator group [45] in five retrospective cohort studies. In a single study reporting an adjusted analysis for mortality with targeted quinolone treatment (24 patients) compared with carbapenems, quinolone treatment was associated with lower mortality [67]. The quinolone group in all studies was very small (4-24 patients) and this analysis is a priori very difficult to analyse in an observational design, because quinolones, administered orally with good bioavailability, were given as stepdown therapy to stable patients. As a result, there is no direct evidence on targeted quinolone therapy for 3GcephRE BSI, but favourable effects were observed in studies assessing Gram-negative bacteriaemia in general, where a proportion of patients is expected to have had 3GcephRE BSI [68].</p>
<p>Aminoglycosides were examined specifically in a single study [69] and as part of a general comparator group in two studies [42,70]. In the single study reporting an adjusted analysis (modernate risk of bias), aminoglycosides as targeted therapy for BSI of urinary tract source were not significantly different from carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam, but with large confidence intervals [69]. Given the paucity of data and observational design, there is very-low-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment for bacteriaemic UTI.</p>
<p><em>Complicated urinary tract infections with or without bacteriaemia.</em> Intravenous fosfomycin was compared with piperacillin-tazo-lactam (ZEUS [71]) or meropenem (FOREST [72]) in two RCT. The ZEUS trial included patients with cUTI or acute pyelonephritis, including few patients with BSI, and the FOREST trial included patients with bacteraemia cUTI caused by <em>E. coli</em>. Both trials showed no significant differences in clinical or microbiological cure between intravenous fosfomycin and comparators in the subgroup of patients with cephalosporin-resistant or ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the FOREST trial, 6/70 (8.6%) patients in the intravenous fosfomycin arm developed heart failure (compared with 1/73 with meropenem). The trials were not powered to show non-inferiority in this subgroup, but together provide high-certainty evidence for treatment of cUTI with intravenous fosfomycin, in patients without septic shock, with or without bacteraemia. Safety should be considered among patients at risk for heart failure. Oral fosfomycin was compared with etrapenem for oral stepdown or outpatient therapy in an observational study in patients with mostly complicated non-bacteraemic UTI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales [73]. The study was at high risk of bias due to the large baseline differences between groups and did not reveal a significant difference between 89 patients treated with fosfomycin and 89 treated with etrapenem (very low certainty of evidence).</p>
<p>Plazomicin was not significantly different from meropenem in a subgroup analysis of an RCT including cUTI caused by 3GCephRE Enterobacterales and reporting on microbiological cure, but with broad confidence intervals (risk difference 7.4, 95% CI -9.6 to 23.1, low risk of bias) [74]. Together with the retrospective cohort study finding no significant advantage in mortality or relapse for carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam over aminoglycosides given as targeted treatment for bacteraemia UTI (moderate risk of bias) [69], there was moderate-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment of cUTI. The risk for nephrotoxicity increases after 7 days of aminoglycoside therapy [75], so shorter durations are recommended.</p>
<p>Other carbapenem-sparing treatments were evaluated in several studies. Carbapenems versus BLBLI were evaluated in one RCT [32] at high risk of bias due to small sample size and baseline differences between groups and several observational studies (moderate to high risk of bias) [28,33,35]. All studies evaluated the targeted treatment of pyelonephritis and assessed variable clinical and microbiological cure and mortality; one study assessed relapse and resistance selection [35]. None of the studies found statistically significant differences between BLBLI and carbapenems, supporting moderate-certainty evidence for BLBLI in the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.</p>
<p>Cephamycins and cefepime were compared with carbapenems in several retrospective cohort studies [76, 77, 78, 79]. None found statistically significant differences between groups, in very small sample sizes (the cephalosporin group ranging from 10 to 23 patients). All studies were at high risk of bias, together providing low-certainty evidence for cepamymcins and cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.</p>
<p>Temocillin provided for more than 50% of the time of effective antibiotic therapy duration was compared with carbapenems in a matched case--control study (144 patients) [80]. The study showed no significant difference between treatment groups in clinical cure, relapse and mortality, but despite matching there were significant differences between groups that were not adjusted for, and the confidence intervals were large, providing very low-certainty evidence for temocillin in cUTI.</p>
<p>Finally, two retrospective studies did not reveal significant differences in clinical cure and microbiological outcomes between carbapenems and any non-carbapenem antibiotic, with high risk of </p>
<p>[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]</p>
<p>therapy occurred in up to 3.7%-8.1% of ceftazidime-avibactam-treated patients [101,108]. More recently in Greece, a novel plasmid-borne Vietnamese extended-spectrum b-lactamase (VEB)-25 has been described in ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant CR-<em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains, independent of ceftazidime-avibactam exposure [109]. VEB-25 seemed to decrease avibatarm&#39;s ability to reduce ceftazidime&#39;s MIC. In an outbreak including eight patients with ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant KPC-2-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> ST-147 in two Greek intensive care units (ICU), horizontal transmission was suspected [110].</p>
<p>Given the observational study designs, the focus on <em>K. pneumoniae</em> and the combination treatments used, there is low-certainty evidence of an advantage of ceftazidime-avibactam over polymyxins for CRE susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam.</p>
<p><em>Meropenem-vaborbactam.</em> Vaborbactam is a novel cyclic boronic acid inhibitor that restores meropenem activity against producers of numerous class A and C b-lactamases, but it is inactive against MBL and OXA-48 producers [111]. Clinical efficacy of meropenem-vaborbactam in patients with infections due to CRE was tested in an RCT (Tango-II) in comparison with best available treatment (BAT) monotherapy or combinations of polymyxins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides or tigecycline; or monotherapy with ceftazidime-avibactam. Forty-seven patients (randomized 2:1) were included in the final analysis and significantly improved cure rates at the end of treatment were found in the meropenem-vaborbactam group (65.6% versus 33.3%, p 0.03) with non-significantly lower 28-day mortality (15.6% (5/32) versus 33.3% (5/15), p 0.2) and lower rates of renal-related adverse events [112]. Based on this small study, there is moderate-certainty evidence for an advantage of meropenem-vaborbactam for susceptible CRE compared with the old antibiotics.</p>
<p><em>Imipenem-relebactam.</em> Relebactam produces a dose-dependent synergy with imipenem against CRE producing KPC or combining AmpC or EBL with reduced permeability, but it is poorly active against OXA-48 producers [113]. Efficacy and safety of imipenem-relebactam have been proven to be comparable to those of impenem or piperacillin-tazoobactam in RCT enrolling patients with cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP; few patients with CR-GNB infections were included in these studies but comparative clinical outcome data for CRE are not available and the numbers are too small for a meaningful analysis [114, 115, 116, 117]. A small RCT including 31 patients with CR-GNB infections (RESTORE-IMI 1) compared the efficacy of imipenemenem-relebactam with the combination of imipenem and colistijn; however, only seven patients with CRE infections were included [118]. Given the paucity of data available for imipenem-relebactam against CRE, we cannot make recommendations on imipenem-relebactam for CRE at this time.</p>
<p><em>Cefderocol.</em> Although non-inferior to carbapenems for UTI and HAP/VAP caused by carbapenem-susceptible GNB [119,120], conflicting results were observed in an open-label RCT designed to assess the efficacy of cefiderocol for CR-GNB (CREDIBLE-CR). A total of 150 patients with proven/suspected CR-GNB infections were randomized 2:1 to receive cefiderocol versus BAT (mostly polymyxin-based combination). The trial included mainly patients with HAP/VAP and BSI and was not powered to conduct specific hypothesis testing. Mortality was higher in the cefiderocol arm at 28 days (25/101, 24.8% with cefiderocol versus 9/49, 18.4% with BAT) and at end of follow up (34/101, 33.7% versus 9/49, 18.4%, respectively). Clinical and microbiological efficacies of cefiderocol versus BAT were similar. A subgroup analysis of patients with MBL-producing CR-GNB infections showed statistically non-significant higher cure and microbiological eradication rates for cefiderocol (16 patients) versus BAT (seven patients), but mortality was not shown, and the analysis did not separate CRE from other CR-GNB. A post-hoc analysis by baseline pathogen revealed that the mortality difference was observed among patients with CRAB infections, but among patients with CR-<em>K. pneumoniae</em>, mortality at end of follow up was 6/28 (21.4%) with ceidferocol versus 4/15 (26.7%) for BAT (and 1/6 versus 0/3 for CR-<em>E. coli</em>, respectively) [121]. Based on these small subgroup analyses, we conclude on low-certainty evidence for non-inferiority of ceidferocol compared with other antibiotics for MBL-producing CRE.</p>
<p><em>Axtreonam.</em> There is no clinical experience evaluating the use of aztreonam monotherapy in the treatment of CRE infections. Aztreonam is uniquely active against MBL-producing CRE [122], but as monotherapy it does not cover other broad-spectrum b-lactamases or carbapenemases, frequently co-produced by such strains. Aztreonam-avibactam is being tested in phase 3 trials and is not currently considered in our guideline because it has not been FDA/EMA approved.</p>
<p><em>Polymyxin.</em> Comparative data on efficacy of polymyxins versus other antibiotics for the treatment of CRE are difficult to evaluate because of the lack of active comparators, concomitant use of other active agents and the frequently suboptimal dosing strategy adopted in the existing studies. Higher mortality among patients with CRE infections was observed with colisti compared with ceftazidime-avibactam in a small retrospective study using inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment [96]. Conversely, lower 30-day mortality was shown in critically ill patients with KPC-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections and septic shock treated with a colisti-containing regimen, compared with colisti-free schemes (hazard ratio (0.21) 95% CI 0.05-0.72) [123]. However, colisti was administered as part of combination therapy regimens in both studies. Hence, there is no evidence on the comparative efficacy of colisti versus other antibiotics for CRE.</p>
<p><em>Aminoglycosides.</em> Two studies from the prospective CRaCKle cohort suggest better clinical outcomes with aminoglycoside-containing regimens compared with tigecycline-containing regimens [124,125]. Van Duin et al. analysed the results from 157 CR-<em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections with a urinary source (20% severe infections) and recorded better clinical cure when compared with tigecycline-based regimens (adjusted HR 5.19, 95% CI 2.03-14.13), whereas no benefit was observed when compared with colisitonating regimens (adjusted HR 1.92, 95% CI 0.63-5.76) [125]. Similarly, Messina et al. observed a higher rate of hospital readmission at 90 days in patients treated with tigecycline-based combinations when compared with aminoglycoside-containing combinations (adjusted HR 4.33, 95% CI 1.67-11.6), in a study where cUTI was the most common source (67% of patients) and 8% of patients were bacteraemic [124]. Microbiological cure was better with aminoglycosides compared with tigecyline for cUTI in the USA [126]. Another cohort from Spain describes 50 patients with sepsis due to carbapenem and colistin-resistant <em>K. pneumoniae</em> with a prevalent respiratory source where the use of gentamicin in fully susceptible isolates (MIC &lt;=4 mg/L) alone or with tigecycline was associated with significantly higher survival at 30 days (adjusted HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.84) compared with non-aminoglycoside regimens [127]. Moreover, in a retrospective cohort of kidney transplant patients, amikican-containing schemes were associated with clinical success for treatment of mixed infections caused by carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant Enterobacterales (adjusted OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.64) [128]. The certainty of the evidence for an advantage of aminoglycosides over tigecycline for cUTI was judged as moderate, with insufficient evidence for other comparisons and other sources of infection.</p>
<p>Tigecyline. Three studies showed that tigecyline was inferior to aminoglycosides for cUTI caused by CRE (moderate certainty of the evidence) [124-126]. Two small studies at high risk of bias showed an advantage to polymyxin-based regimens compared with tigecyline-based regimens for CRE BSI [129,130]. Finally, out of three additional studies assessing tigecyline or eravacyline for CRE infections of any source [131-133], a single study showed survival advantage to tigecyline compared with colistin-based therapy for CRE and/or CRAB, explained by the higher severity of patients receiving colistin [132]. Among critically ill patients with MDR-GNB infections treated with different dosages of tigecyline, the only independent predictor of clinical cure was the use of high tigecyline dose in the subgroup of patients with VAP [134]. However, more than 80% of patients in this study received concomitant active antibiotics. A higher dosage of tigecyline (200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg twice a day) in combination with other drugs was associated with non-significantly higher survival rates also in a cohort of 40 KPC-BSI compared with the standard dosage (100 mg loading dose following by 50 mg twice a day) [135]. Overall, there was low-certainty evidence for the inferiority of tigecyline compared with other antibiotics for cUTI and BSI caused by CRE. There are no studies comparing tigecyline with other antibiotics for HAP/VAP and IAI caused by CRE. If used, high-dosing regimens should be used for HAP/VAP.</p>
<p>Fostomycin. Potential efficacy of intravenous fostomycin for CRE has been described in <em>in vitro</em> studies and small case series with variable clinical response [136-138]. In a study from China the use of fostomycin in combination with other antibiotics for treating CRE-BSI was associated with non-significantly higher survival compared with non-fostomycin-based schemes in an adjusted analysis [139]. There is no evidence for fostomycin monotherapy for CRE.</p>
<p>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Within the already mentioned CRACKle prospective cohort, a small subgroup of patients with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-susceptible CRE infections received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-based schemes with mortality rates comparable to other treatments. However, in three out of four available follow-up cultures, subsequent isolates were found to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [140] trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (no evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).</p>
<p>Eravacyline. Eravacyline has an observed two-fold <em>in vitro</em> higher activity compared with tigecyline against Gram-negative bacteria; however no patients with CRE were included in the trials that brought to its approval [95,141] (no evidence for eravacyline).</p>
<p>Plazomicin. Efficacy of plazomicin for the treatment of CRE infections was planned to be tested in the CARE-RCT in comparison with colistin (in combination with meropenem or tigecycline, NCT01970371). The sponsor decided to suspend the study after 2 years because of enrolment difficulties. Available results showed that all-cause mortality at 28 days was 8/20 with colisitin combination therapy (6/15 with BSI) versus 2/17 with plazomicin combination therapy (1/14 with BSI) [142]. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on plazomicin compared to colistin for CRE.</p>

<h4 id="_recommendations_"><em>Recommendations</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>For patients with CRE infections susceptible to and treated with ceftazidime-aubactam, meropenem-vaborbactam or cefederocol, we do not recommend combination therapy (<strong>strong recommendation against use, low certainty of evidence</strong>)</li>
<li>For patients with severe infections caused by CRE carrying MBL and/or resistant to new antibiotic monotherapies, we suggest aztream and ceftazidime-aubactam combination therapy (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with severe infections caused by CRE susceptible <em>in vitro</em> only to polymyxin, aminoglycosides, tigecyline or fostomycin, or in the case of non-availability of new BLBLI, we suggest treatment with more than one drug active <em>in vitro</em> (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>). No recommendation for or against specific combinations can be provided.</li>
<li>We suggest that clinicians avoid carbapenem-based combination therapy for CRE infections (<strong>conditional recommendation against use, low certainty of evidence</strong>), unless the meropenem MIC is &lt;= 8 mg/L, where high-dose extended-infusion meropenem may be used as part of combination therapy if the new BLBLI are not used (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>In patients with non-severe infections or among patients with low-risk infections, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we consider the use of monotherapy chosen from among the <em>in vitro</em> active old drugs, on an individual basis and according to the source of infection as good clinical practice (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="_review-of-the-evidence_"><em>Review of the evidence</em></h4>
<p>Thirty-five studies assessed mortality (all-cause at any time-point) in patients with CRE infections receiving antibiotic combination versus monotherapy and the results are conflicting [97,123,128,130,139,140,143-171]. Certainty of the evidence was very low because of the observational nature of most of the studies (34 out of 35 studies) and the considerable risk of bias (high in 12 studies; moderate in 14; and low in 9). Most importantly, the study definitions of &#39;combination therapy&#39; were highly variable, including poorly specified treatment schemes, comprising from two up to five antibiotics with variable <em>in vitro</em> activity and different dosages and durations. Adjustment for relevant confounders was seldom available, mostly because of the very small sample sizes.</p>
<p>Single versus multiple-covering therapy. In the few available studies with adequate sample size and adjustment for confounders, the evidence seems to favour combination over monotherapy in terms of better clinical outcomes [123,147,152,159,163,164,172,173]. This advantage emerges mainly in subgroups of patients with more severe disease and when combination is defined as regimens including more than one <em>in vitro</em> active antimicrobial. In a large retrospective cohort study including patients with BSI (<em>N</em> = 447) and non-bacteraemic infections (<em>n</em> = 214) caused by KPC-producing (K).</p>
<p><em>pneumoniae</em> in Italy, treatment including two or more <em>in vitro</em> active antibiotics was associated with lower 14-day mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.77) [164]. In the retrospective INCEMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE ISI at high risk for death, with an INKEMENT score of 8-15 (<em>n</em> = 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Among patients with lower INCEMENT scores (<em>n</em> = 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56-2.56) [152]. Use of two or more <em>in vitro</em> active antibiotics (including colistin, tiegycline, gentamicin, carbapenems, rifampicin) was independently associated with 30-day survival in retrospective study including 111 critically ill patients with KPC-producing (K). <em>pneumoniae</em> infections and septic shock [123]. Lower efficacy of a single drug regimen with these drugs has been attributed to the often suboptimal dosage and the unsuitable pharmacokinetics--pharmacodynamics profile for some infection sites [174, 175, 176]. Unfortunately, none of these studies focused on specific antibiotic combinations, so information on which antimicrobials should be included in the treatment scheme cannot be derived even from higher-certainty evidence. When looking at smaller studies analysing specific drugs, polymyxin and tiegycline seemed the antimicrobials for which the addition of a companion drug seems more advisable [143, 146, 147, 151, 152, 153, 155, 157, 160, 161, 164, 167, 177, 178]. Due to the high heterogeneity of treatment included, even in smaller studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn on which companion drug should be preferred when prescribing polymyxin and tiegycline, but treatment with more than one <em>in vitro</em> active antibiotic might be beneficial (moderate-certainty evidence).</p>
<h3 id="carbapenem-combination-therapy">Carbapenem combination therapy</h3>
<p>The inclusion of a carbapenem in the combination scheme for treating carbapenem-resistant infections has been a long-standing matter of debate. Two investigator-initiated RCT, the AIDA and OVERCOME trials, evaluated the efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-meropenem combination therapy in patients with severe infections caused by CR-GNB, mainly HAP/VAP and BSI [160, 179]. Subgroup analysis of patients with CRE infections did not show statistically significant differences in 28-day mortality between colistin monotherapy and colistin-carbapenem combination therapy in both trials: 12/34 (35%) versus 8/39 (21%) (p 0.24) in AIDA [160] and 11/35 (31%) versus 7/36 (19%) (p 0.25) in OVERCOME [179], respectively.</p>
<p>In the retrospective Italian cohort study of patients&#39; BSI and non-bacteraemic infections due to KPC-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, combination therapy including a carbapenem was associated with lower 14-day mortality when the meropenem MIC were &lt;=8 mg/L [164]. A continuation and re-analysis of the same cohort showed a similar association between high-dose carbapenem-containing combinations (6 g/day, 3 hours infusion) and 14-day survival compared with non-carbapemen containing combinations, even when the MICs were higher (&gt;=16 mg/L) [180].</p>
<p>We concluded low-certainty evidence for an advantage of high-dose extended-infusion meropenem-polymxin combination therapy over polymyxin monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections caused by CRE, mainly KPC-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em>.</p>
<h3 id="double-carbapenem-combination-therapy">Double-carbapenem combination therapy</h3>
<p>The rationale for using double-carbapenem therapy for treating CRE infections is based on the higher affinity of etrapenem for carbapenemases and a hypothesis that consumption of the carbapnemases by etrapenem will allow for the action of the other carbapenem. In vitro data for synergistic interactions are conflicting [181, 182]. Two observational studies from Italy and one from the USA suggested better survival in patients with invasive KPC infections treated with a double carbapenem regimen when compared with other regimens, even with high carbapenem MICs [183, 184, 185]. Lack of adjustment for confounders, small sample size and use of other drugs in the combinations made the authors of these studies conclude that, although promising, this option requires further evaluation (Insufficient evidence).</p>
<h3 id="new-antibiotic-combination-therapies">New antibiotic combination therapies</h3>
<p>Five retrospective cohorts enrolled a total of 824 patients from three countries (USA, Spain and Italy) and compared ceftazidime-aubactam in combination with other antibiotics versus ceftazidime-aubactam monotherapy, showing no difference in mortality and clinical failure in mixed infections caused by KPC and OXA-48 producers [99, 186, 187, 188, 188]. The largest study included 577 patients with KPC-producing <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections, mostly BSI, in Italy and showed also that prolonged infusion (&gt;=3 hours) of ceftazidime-aubactam and appropriate renal adjustment were associated with 30-day survival [188], supporting our good practice statement for optimal antibiotic administration schedules.</p>
<p>Cefazidime-aubactam in combination with afternoon is active in vitro against a substantial proportion of MBL producers, for which treatment options are lacking [189, 190]. Following a small case series reporting on patients with MBL-producing CRE treated with ceftazidime-aubactam-aztreonam [191], an observational prospective study was conducted including 102 patients with MBL-producing CRE bacteraemia (82 NDM-producing strains and 20 VIM-producing strains) treated with ceftazidime-aublactam in combination with aztreonam compared with other <em>in vitro</em> covering therapies, mostly combinations [192]. The isolates were mostly non-susceptible to aztreonam alone. Using propensity-score-adjusted multivariable regression, the study showed a significant independent association between ceftazidime-aublactam-aztreonam and lower 30-day mortality (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13-0.74), clinical failure and length of hospital stay, providing moderate-certainty evidence for ceftazidime-aublactam in combination with aztreonam against BSI caused by MBL-producing CRE susceptible to the combination. There are currently no standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods recommended or clinical interpretative breakpoints approved for the combination.</p>
<p>In the CREDIBLE RCT [121], an observational post-hoc comparison between patients receiving cefleforocol monotherapy versus ceftoferocol combination therapy, clinical and microbiological cure rates were similar, but results were not presented separately for CRE and mortality data were not available. There are no studies addressing the clinical use in monotherapy versus combination of recently marketed antibiotics with activity against CRE (imipenem-relebactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, eravacycline and plazomicin).</p>
<p>Despite numerous results of <em>in vitro</em> studies showing reduction in resistance development when polymyxin [7] and ceftazidime-aubactam [193] are combined with other antibiotics, these results are not confirmed in clinical studies. In two retrospective cohort studies of 77 and 577 patients with KPC-producing CRE infections treated with ceftazidime-aubactam, development of resistance to ceftazidime-aubactam occurred in 10.4% and 3.8%, respectively, and was not associated with its use as monotherapy or in combination regimens [186].</p>

<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
<li>In patients with severe infections due to DTR-CRPA, we suggest therapy with ceftolozane-tazobactam if active <em>in vitro</em> (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, very low certainty of evidence</strong>). Insufficient evidence is available for imipenem-relebactam, cefiderocol and ceftazidime-avibactam at this time.</li>
<li>In patients with non-severe or low-risk CRPA infections, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we consider it good clinical practice to use the old antibiotics, chosen from among the <em>in vitro</em> active antibiotics on an individual basis and according to the source of infection (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h3>
<p>The clinical evidence on management of DTR-CRPA is highly limited. Data from RCT for the new BLBLI are limited to small subgroup analyses of the registration trials, some of which are based on single patients There are no comparative RCT data on the effect of ceftolozane-tazobactam on CRPA infections, although this is the intended use of the drug. Overall, there is no high-certainty evidence pointing to a preferred antibiotic treatment for CRPA.</p>
<h3 id="new-blbli">New BLBLI</h3>
<p>Of the potentially active new BLBLI, only imipenem-relebactam has been tested against CR-GNB in an RCT, in the RESTORE-IMI 1 trial. The trial included patients with HAP, VAP, UTI and IAI caused by CR-GNB, of which CRPA was the most common (16/21 patients allocated to imipenem-relebactam and 8/10 allocated to colistin with imipenem). A favourable overall response to treatment at 28 days, with a definition tailored per infection source, was observed in 13/16 with imipenem-relebactam compared with 5/8 with colistin and impiemen, adjusted difference 3.1 (95% CI -19.8 to 38.2) [118].</p>
<p>Of the RCT evaluating ceftolozane-tazobactam, the trial including patients with nosocomial pneumonia (ASPECT-NP) reported clinical care among 4/10 versus 2/5 patients with XDR-PA treated with ceftolozane-tazobactam versus meropement, respectively [90]. Data on CRPA, however, are not available. Treatment with ceftolozane-tazobactam (100 patients) was compared with polymyxins or aminoglycosides (100 patients), among patients with MDR/XDR <em>P aeruginosa</em> mixed infections (mostly pneumonia) in a retrospective cohort study [194]. Clinical care was higher (adjusted OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.31-5.30) and nephrotoxicity was lower (adjusted OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.22) with ceftolozane-tazobactam. Aminoglycoside/polymyxins were given mostly in combination therapies, patient selection was unclear, baseline difference between groups could not be fully adjusted and data on carbapenem resistance was not provided (high risk of bias).</p>
<p>Overall, given the paucity of data on effects against CRPA, we conclude on very-low-certainty evidence for non-inferiority of imipenem-relebactam compared with colistin-meropenem combination therapy and superiority of ceftolozane-tazobactam compared with aminoglycoside/polymyxin combination therapies for CRPA infections with no evidence for other new BLBLI.</p>
<h3 id="other-antibiotics">Other antibiotics</h3>
<p>In the CREDIBLE RCT, mortality at the end of the study was similar for patients with baseline monomicrobial CRPA infections for cefiderocol (2/11 patients) compared with BAT (2/11 patients). Clinical cure (7/12 versus 5/10 patients, respectively) and microbiological persistence (4/12 versus 2/10 patients, respectively) were not different, in very small numbers (very-low-cer-tainty evidence for non-inferiority of ceftolocol compared with BAT).</p>
<p>A small, retrospective cohort of 49 patients with nosocomial pneumonia, mostly VAP, caused by CRPA intermediately susceptible to doripenem (MIC 4-8 mg/L), in Thailand compared high-dose, 4-hour infusion of doripenem versus colistin, both combined with fosromycin. Undaylated all-cause 30-day mortality was not different; 10/24 versus 10/25, respectively, as were clinical and microbiological cure rates [195]. No clinical comparative studies were found for intravenous fosromycin or eravacycline.</p>
<p>A before-after retrospective study compared the nephrotoxicity of colistin and polymyxin B among critically ill patients with severe, at-risk infections, caused by MDR <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (46 patients) and <em>A. baumanini</em> (107 patients), showing higher RIFLE-defined nephrotoxicity with colistin (adjusted HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.35-3.82) [196].</p>

<h4 id="polymorphism-based-combination-therapy">Polymorphism-based combination therapy</h4>
<p>Both in the AIDA and OVERCOME RCT comparing colistin with colistin-carbapenem therapy for severe infections caused by CR-GNB there were no significant differences in 28-day mortality in the subgroup of patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections (21 patients in AIDA and 43 in OVERCOME) [160,179]. In a retrospective study evaluating 114 patients with nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, with isolation of XDR-<em>P. aeruginosa</em>, colistin given alone or with a non-active antibiotic was associated with higher mortality than colistin combined with another active antibiotic (adjusted OR 6.63, 95% CI 1.99-22.05) [197]. From other observational studies, the results for the subgroup of patients with CRPA were non-adjusted. In a retrospective study evaluating critically ill patients with mixed infections caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> there was no difference in 30-day mortality among patients treated with polymyxin compared with polymyxin and a second <em>in vitro</em> inactive agent, overall; in a small subgroup of patients with XDR-<em>P. aeruginosa</em>, mortality was lower when combinations were used (14/15 dead with monotherapy versus 0/3 with combinations) [198]. In another retrospective analysis, Falagas et al. assessed clinical cure rates comparing colistin monotherapy with different combinations for mixed infections due to MDR-CN. There was no significant difference in outcomes in a small subgroup of patients with MDR-<em>P. aeruginosa</em> (9/12 were cured with colisitin monotherapy compared with 42/56 with combinations) [199].</p>
<p>There was very low-certainty evidence for an advantage of polymyxin combined with another active antibiotic over polymyxin alone or combined with inactive antibiotics. There was low-certainty evidence on the lack of advantage of carbapenem-polymyxin combination therapy compared with polymyxin monotherapy for CRPA.</p>
<h3 id="other-combination-therapy">Other combination therapy</h3>
<p>A cohort study summarized retrospectively outcomes for patients treated with ceftolozane-tazobactam for MDR- or XDR-<em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections. There was no difference in cure, defined as clinical and microbiological cure at day 7, between patients given ceftolozane-tazobactam monotherapy (14/21, 66.7%) and those treated with ceftolozane-tazobactam in combination with colistin or an aminoglycoside (21/35, 60%), without adjustment [200]. The study found no significant difference in development of resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam during therapy between monotherapy and combination therapy. Overall, there was no evidence for other combination therapy for CRPA.</p>

<li>For patients with CRAB susceptible to sublactam and HAP/VAP, we suggest ampicillin-sublactam (<strong>conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with CRAB resistant to sublactam, a polymyxin or high-dose tigecycline can be used if active <em>in vitro</em>. Lacking evidence, we cannot recommend on the preferred antibiotic.</li>
<li>We conditionally recommend against cefiderocol for the treatment of infections caused by CRAB (<strong>conditional recommendations against use, low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="review-of-the-evidence">Review of the evidence</h3>
<p>Antibiotics active <em>in vitro</em> against CRAB have been directly compared, mostly in retrospective observational studies. The studies generally addressed all species within the <em>A. baumannii</em> complex, not specifically <em>A. baumannii</em> (genospespecies 2 of the <em>Acinetobacter caloaceticus-A. baumannii</em> complex), because automated detection tests do not discriminate between the different genospesic included in the <em>A. baumannii</em> complex (<em>A. calcoaceticus, A. baumannii</em>, genospesices 3 and genospees 13TU). The most common infection described with CRAB is pneumonia, frequently VAP. As colistin&#39;s concentrations in epithelial lining fluid after intravenous administration are negligible [201,202], we were interested in separate assessment of pneumonia and other sources of infection, but the data were insufficient to provide recommendations by source of infection. Of the antibiotics that have been considered to date, EUCAST does not provide breakpoints for sublactam and tigecycline, for <em>Acinetobacter</em>.</p>
<p><em>Polymyxin versus ampicillin-sulbactam.</em> Several small studies compared polymyxinx, mostly colistin, with ampicillin-sulbactam. A small RCT using alternation as the randomization method (not true randomization) included 28 patients in ICU with VAP caused by CRAB susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam and did not find a difference between ampicillin-sulbactam and colisin in mortality, or clinical or microbiological failure [203]. Nephrotoxicity was more common with colistin without statistical significance. An RCT evaluating 47 ICU patients diagnosed with CRAB VAP compared colistin and sublactam, both combined with meropenem, with similar results [204]. A retrospective study including 167 patients with different CRAB infections, mostly in ICU and mostly with primary BSI or pneumonia, compared colisin or polymyxin B with ampicillin-sulbactam, with additional antibiotics not active <em>in vitro</em> in both groups [205]. Mortality at end of treatment (but not in-hospital mortality) was significantly higher in the polymyxin group (adjusted OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.03-4.16). A retrospective cohort study of 98 patients in ICU with CRAB VAP compared low-dose colisin (6 MU/day) with ampicillin-sulbactam, showing significantly higher all-cause mortality with colisin, higher microbiological failure and no difference in clinical failure [206]. A small RCT, presented as an interim study, compared colistin with extended infusion ampicillin-sulbactam (6 g intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 2:1 four times a day) both combined with high-dose levofloxacin for the treatment of <em>A. baumannii</em> VAP in an ICU where all <em>A. baumannii</em> are carbapenem-resistant [207]. The study showed a large advantage to ampicillin-sulbactam in 14-day and 28-day mortality, clinical response and renal failure (28-day mortality 9/11 with colisin versus 5/12 with ampicillin-sulbactam). None of the studies addressed the comparative rates of resistance development during therapy. Most studies considered isolates with MIC &lt;=8/4 mg/L as susceptible to sublactam. Dosing of ampicillin-sulbactam was quite heterogeneous across studies, ranging from 3 to 16 g/8 h (for ampicillin-sulbactam 2:1). The data support an advantage to ampicillin-sulbactam over polymyxinx for CRAB, but the evidence is of low certainty.</p>
<p><em>Polymyxin versus tigecycline.</em> Colistin has been compared with tigecycline in four retrospective observational studies. Most included patients in ICU, mainly with pneumonia, and colistin and tigecycline were commonly combined with other antibiotics [132,208,209,210]. All studies, except one [132], demonstrated higher mortality and lower clinical response with tigecycline monotherapy, although without statistical significance. In one study, microbiological success was significantly better with colisin [210]. In three studies, nephrotoxicity was more frequent with colisin [208,210]. Low doses of tigecycline were commonly used (50 mg twice a day), while double dosing may be more appropriate [211]. From these data, no conclusion can be drawn (no evidence).</p>
<p><em>Tigecycline versus sublactam-based therapy.</em> A comparison between tigecycline and sulbactam has been included in five retrospective cohort studies. A single-centre, hospital-wide, retrospective study in Taiwan included 386 patients and compared tigecycline-based therapy with sublactam-based therapy for hospital-acquired infections caused by tigecycline and sulbactam-susceptible CRAB, respectively [212]. Sulbactam was combined with impienem, and tigecycline was prescribed variably alone or with a carbapenem of another b-lactam. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality or length of stay, but there was a significantly lower rate of clinical or microbiological failure in the tigecycline-based group. Another single-centre retrospective study in Taiwan included 84 patients with CRAB pneumonia that were matched to a historical cohort of 84 patients treated with sublactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, mostly given in combination therapies [213]. Patients with BSI were excluded. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to 30-day mortality or clinical failure, but there was a significant advantage to sublactam-based therapy in microbiological cure. A multicentre study in Taiwan comparing retrospectively treatment strategies among critically ill patients hospitalized in ICU with CRAB pneumonia, included a comparison between sublactam-based combination or monotherapy (12 patients) and tigecycline monotherapy (84 patients) [214]. ICU mortality (adjusted OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.02) and treatment failure (adjusted OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.55) were less frequent with sulbactam-based therapy. A single-centre retrospective study in China included 210 patients with CRAB-BSI, mostly in ICU, comparing cefoperazone-sulbactam to tigecycline, both given mostly in combination with other antibiotics [215]. The study demonstrated significantly lower 28-day mortality with sulbactam-based treatment (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.94), despite the fact that 80% of the isolates were resistant to sublactam [215]. The last study, retrospectively evaluated 274 episodes of MDR-BSI hospital-wide in one centre in China, showing unadjusted lower mortality with cefoperazone-sulbactam-containing regimens compared with tigecycline-based therapy, although non susceptibility rates to sublactam were high [216]. An increased risk of death with tigecycline for HAP, VAP and bacteriaemia has been reported, in general, not specifically for CR-GNB [92]. The data support low-certainty evidence for an advantage of sublactam-based therapy over tigecyline.</p>
<p><em>Cefiderocol.</em> Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin whose (\text{MIC}_{90}) for <em>A. baumannini</em> is in the range of 1-8 mg. Cefiderocol was compared with BAT for CR-GNB infections in the previously described CREDIBLE RCT [121, 217] Among patients with CRAB infections in the CREDIBLE trial, the 28-day mortality rates were 19/39 (49%) in the cefiderocol group (21/42, 50% with CR-<em>Acinetobacter</em>&gt;0.) versus 3/17 (18%) in the BAT group. Overall, in the trial, there was no advantage to cefiderocol with respect to clinical or microbiological eradication. In the APEKS-NP RCT, similar mortality, clinical and microbiological outcomes were documented for cefiderocol versus high-dose extended-infusion meropenem, in the subgroup of 36 patients with pneumonia and <em>A. baumannini</em> species with meropenem MIC &gt;8 mg/mL, evaluated before switching to <em>in vitro</em> covering therapy in the meropenem arm. Given the limited information available to date, we conclude on low-certainty evidence against cefiderocol treatment of CRAB infections.</p>
<p><em>Eravacyline.</em> Eravacyline is a novel synthetic tetracycline (fluorocycline) that has two-to eight-fold lower MICs than tigecyline against CRAB. It was evaluated in two RCT compared with etrapemem and meropenem for cIAI [95, 141] Although potentially active in vitro, no data are available on its clinical efficacy against CRAB infections.</p>
<p><em>Other antibiotics.</em> Small retrospective studies evaluated treatment with aminoglycosides [218, 219] and tetracyclines other than tigecyline [218, 220] for infections caused by MDR-GNB and CRAB. These studies are small and show inconclusive data (no evidence).</p>
<p><em>Question 4.2: Should combination therapy be used for the treatment of CRAB?</em></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For all patients with CRAB infections, we do not recommend polymxin-meropenem combination therapy (<strong>strong recommendation against use; high certainty of evidence</strong>) or polymxin-rifampin combination therapy (<strong>strong recommendation against use, moderate certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with severe and high-risk CRAB infections, we suggest combination therapy including two <em>in vitro</em> active antibiotics among the available antibiotics (polymynxin, amino-glycoside, tigecycline, sublactam combinations) (<strong>conditional recommendation for use, very low certainty of evidence</strong>).</li>
<li>For patients with CRAB infections with a meropenem MIC &lt;8 mg/L, we consider carbapenem combination therapy, using high-dose extended-infusion carbapenem dosing, as good clinical practice (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Review of the evidence</em></p>
<p>Combination therapy for CRAB has been suggested based on in vitro studies showing synergistic interactions between polymxins and meropenem, imipenem, doripenem [7], rifampicin [4, 221], vancomycin [222] and many antibiotics [223] and non-antibiotics [224]. Synergistic combinations might be associated with better survival [225], but for clinical adoption specific combination therapies need to be assessed in clinical studies. Most of the data on CRAB rely on low-certainty observational studies, assessing a large number of antibiotic regimens, many times grouped to &#39;combination therapy&#39; that does not allow the appraisal of specific antibiotics regimens with biological plausibility of a beneficial interaction. We identified 29 studies comparing monotherapy with combination therapy [160, 198, 199, 209, 214, 215, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]; six of which were RCT [160, 228, 236, 238, 240, 245].</p>
<p><em>Colistin-arbapemen combination therapy.</em> The combination of colistin with meropenem was assessed in the previously described AIDA RCT, including 406 patients with CR-GNB overall and among them 312 with CRAB bacteriaemia, VAP or hospital-acquired pneumonia [160]. There was no significant difference between colistin monotherapy and colistin-meropenem with respect to a primary composite outcome of clinical failure at day 14 or 14-day mortality overall in the randomized trial population (relative risk (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 for failure and RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84-128 for mortality with colistin monotherapy) and among patients with CRAB (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.09 and RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.82-1.52, respectively). A post-hoc analysis of this trial addressed the subgroup of patients with infections caused by CRAB resistant also to colistin by broth microdilution, showing no benefit to the combination over colistin among patients with colistin-resistant CRAB [237]. The OVERCOME trial was a double-blind RCT comparing colistin monotherapy with colistin-meropenem combination for HAP/VAP and BSI caused by CR-GNB that similarly included mostly patients with CRAB of infections [179]. Mortality at 28 days was similar for colistin monotherapy 76/165 (46%) and colistin-meropenem 69/163 (42%) (p 0.5).</p>
<p>Several observational studies, assessing the combination of polymxins and carbapamens specifically, showed a significant association between use of the combination and survival or clinical cure [198, 235, 247] whereas others did not [199, 244]. Many observational studies included patients treated with a polymyxin-carbapenem combination in a larger group of patients treated with different combination therapies. These studies mostly showed an association between combination therapy and survival, compared with polymxin monotherapy. However, from these studies the effects of a specific combination regimen cannot be assessed.</p>
<p>The RCT, including a considerable sample of patients with severe, high-risk, infections caused by CRAB, contribute to high-certainty evidence against carbapenem-polymxin combination therapies for CRAB infections [160, 179]. <em>Acinetobacter baumannini</em> when resistant to carbapemens is typically highly resistant, with MICs &gt;16 mg/L. If isolates with lower MICs to a carbapenem are identified, or should these become prevalent, combination therapy with high-dose carbapenem may be considered, preferably administered through extended or continuous infusion.</p>
<p><em>Colistin-rifampin combination therapy.</em> The combination of colistin with rifampin has been assessed in three RCT [238, 240, 245]. In the only powered RCT, including 209 patients with CRAB infections, mostly pneumonia, there was no advantage to colistin-rifampin over colistin monotherapy with respect to 30-day mortality [238]. Microbiological cure was higher with combination therapy, but surveillance for continued carriage of CRAB was not conducted. Another small trial included 43 patients in ICU with VAP caused by CRAB, showing no difference between colistin-rifampin and colistin monotherapy with respect to in-hospital mortality and microbiological failure [245]. The third RCT included only nine patients assessing death, and clinical and microbiological response, but the lack of differences between the groups are not informative in this small sample [240]. Rifampin was included in a few patients treated with combination therapy in an observational study comparing mixed combinations with polymyxin monotherapy [248], showing no significant survival advantage to the combination. Overall, there was moderate certainty evidence against rifampicin-colistin combination therapy for CRAB.</p>
<p>Other combinationsOther combinations have been tested in single studies. Colistin-vancomycin has been assessed in a retrospective observational study among 57 patients in ICU mostly with CRAB pneumonia, compared with colistian monotherapy [239]. No difference in mortality or length of stay was observed, but there was a significantly higher rate of nephrotoxicity with the combination. In a retrospective study including critically ill patients in ICU treated with colistin-based regimens, colistian-glycoprotein combination therapy in 42 patients was not significantly different from colistian monotherapy administered to 61 patients with respect to 30-day mortality, ICU stay and hospital stay [241]. The study included a mix of MDR Gram-negative infections, most (59/103) with MDR <em>A. baumannii</em>. Colistin-fosromycin was compared with colistian monotherapy in a small RCT including 94 patients with infections caused by CRAB, usually resistant to fosfomycin [228]. There was no significant difference between groups in 30-day mortality or adverse events, but combination resulted in lower microbiological failure. Other observational studies comparing monotherapy (usually collision) with combination therapy (usually mixed) show conflicting results [198,199,209,214,215,226,227,229,230,235,243,244,246,247,249,250]; however, the bulk of the data seem to show no advantage to combination therapy (very-low-certainty evidence).</p>
<p>Double covering therapy might be considered, provided that the CRAB is susceptible to more than one antibiotic. The combination of colistian and ampicillin-sublactam versus colistian alone has been assessed in a small RCT including 49 patients in ICU with VAP caused by CRAB susceptible to ampicillin-sublactam [236]. There was an advantage to combination therapy with respect to clinical failure, but no difference in 28-day mortality. A systematic review of observational studies showed an association between colistian monotherapy and mortality when compared with potentially double-covering antibiotic combinations (polymxin, aminoglycoside, tigecycline, sulbactam combinations) [172]. Very-low-certainty evidence exists for double covering combination therapy for CRAB.</p>
<h3 id="general-practice-recommendations-and-antibiotic-stewardship-considerations">General practice recommendations and antibiotic stewardship considerations</h3>
<p>Optimal antibiotic dosing schemes should be used, with attention to adverse effects, especially with the old antibiotics--polymyxins and aminoglycosides (<strong>good practice statement</strong>). Dosing and mode of administration should be optimized by pathogen and indication, with use of therapeutic drug monitoring whenever available (<strong>good practice statement</strong>). We recommend referring to EUCAST&#39;s recommended dosing (<a href="https://www.eucast.org/clinical.breakpoints/">https://www.eucast.org/clinical.breakpoints/</a>). Source control should always be a priority, to optimize outcomes and shorten antibiotic treatment durations. The guidelines do not address allergies to the recommended antibiotics that should be considered before antibiotic prescription. Nebilized antibiotics were not considered in the current guideline but were addressed by an ESCMID position statement [251]. Testing against the new BIBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB that are resistant to all b-lactams. Follow-up cultures are recommended in case of treatment failure, especially for CR-GNB, to detect resistance development (<strong>good practice statement</strong>). For pan-resistant CR-GNB, the panel recommends selection of antibiotic treatment with the least resistant antibiotic/s based on MICs relative to the breakpoints, but mainly optimal source control (<strong>good practice statement</strong>).</p>
<p>Throughout the current guideline, antibiotic stewardship considerations have been introduced. The most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy. We support antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistian (a last resort antibiotic for CRAB and MBL-producing Enterobacterales) and the new BIBLI. Many good practice statements are provided in the guidelines, when no evidence is available and clinical practice mandates decision-making. Many of them place a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations and can be tailored locally.</p>
<p>The current guidelines address antibiotic treatment targeted to specific pathogens. Empirically, before pathogen identification, these pathogens should be targeted among patients considered at high risk for CR-GNB infections. A difficult antibiotic stewardship balance exists between achieving appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with infections due to CR-GNB and the need to conserve last resort therapies for these bacteria. The empirical treatment phase is relevant to a much larger population than targeted treatment. Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.</p>
<p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="considering-costs-and-equity">Considering costs and equity</h3>
<p>Antibiotics, both old and new, are not equally available worldwide. In low-resource settings, costs of the new antibiotics might prohibit their use; and even in other settings costs of the new antibiotics enter the consideration for use. Antibiotics critical to management of the priority pathogens should be defined and more efforts should be implemented to ensure the universal availability of these antibiotics. Differential costs of the new antibiotics for different socio-economic settings will allow better equity of patient management.</p>
<h3 id="research-needs">Research needs</h3>
<p>Recommendations for further research were not developed formally and were not graded. Most recommendations in the guideline are based on very-low-certainty evidence or no evidence. Only RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed. Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. Investigator-initiated RCT are needed addressing these gaps. Concomitantly, observational studies can include a broader and larger patient population and with improved methods to reduce bias can portray the real life and support decision-making. Antibiotic treatments addressed as the exposures in existing studies were frequently combined with other antibiotics, switched and crossed; study designs allowing a cleaner assessment of individual antibiotics or specific combinations are needed. Studies addressing targeted treatment should address the empirical antibiotic treatment and report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of the isolated bacteria to direct more individualized treatment. The ecological impact of different treatment strategies should be evaluated.</p>
<p>Evidence is lacking on the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics (e.g. pivmecilliam, fosfomycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), for initial treatment of clinically stable patients with UTI or as oral follow up, compared with continued definitive intravenous therapy. Furthermore, more studies are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens (dose, frequency, intermittent or prolonged administration) and treatment durations especially when using b-lactam antibiotics.</p>

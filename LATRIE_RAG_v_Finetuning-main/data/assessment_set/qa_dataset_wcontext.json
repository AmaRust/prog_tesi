For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement).

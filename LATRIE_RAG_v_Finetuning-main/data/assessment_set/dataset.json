    {"question": "What is the estimated number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Europe in 2015?", "answer": "600,000", "context": "According to estimates from the European Center of Disease and Control (ECDC), antibiotic-resistant bacteria caused 600.000 infections and 27.000 attributable deaths in 2015 in Europe [2]. Almost 70% of this disease burden, in terms of both number of cases and attributable deaths, is caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB). Ratios of attributable deaths compared with the non-infected population or with a population infected with susceptible isolates of the same bacteria are positive, with a factor-increase ranging from 1.5 for MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 6.2 for carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from 2007 to 2015 [2]. The substantial burden of disease, together with the paucity of available treatments and slowly progressing antibiotic pipeline have led the World Health Organization to prioritize four MDR-GNB phenotypes as of critical priority for future research and development investments: CR-Acinetobacter baumannii, CR-P. aeruginosa and CR-and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales [3]. Since the issuing of the priority list in 2017, five new antibiotics with activity against MDR-GNB were approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), none of which has a new mode of action and all followed a fast-track development pathway that is granted to drugs potentially addressing unmet medical needs [4]."},
    {"question": "What is the main objective of the evidence-based guidelines for treating infections caused by MDR-GNB in hospitalized patients?", "answer": "To provide recommendations for treatment of infections caused by MDR-GNB in hospitalized patients", "context": "In parallel with huge efforts by pharmaceutical companies, and profit and non-profit organizations to promote research and development of new antibiotics, the scientific community and public health agencies are strongly calling for an increasingly parsimonious use of available antibiotics in order to prevent further development of resistance. In this paradoxical scenario prescribing antibiotics for MDR-GNB infections has become a significant challenge for clinicians worldwide, stretched between the well-known limitations of the old drugs, fear of promoting resistance by using the new antibiotics, the paucity of data on the effects of newly developed antibiotics against MDR-GNB and the costs of the new antibiotics [5]. The objective of these evidence-based guidelines is to provide recommendations for treatment of infections caused by MDR-GNB in hospitalized patients."},
    {"question": "What is the definition of sepsis?", "answer": "Severe presentation of infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection", "context": "Sepsis: We adopted the sepsis-3 definition for sepsis, as severe presentation of infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection [9]."},
    {"question": "What is the definition of septic shock?", "answer": "When the underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality", "context": "Septic shock: We similarly accept the sepsis-3 definitions for septic shock when the underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality [9]."},
    {"question": "What are considered severe infections?", "answer": "Sepsis or septic shock", "context": "Severe infections: sepsis or septic shock."},
    {"question": "What types of infections are defined as low-risk infections based on the INCREMENT score?", "answer": "Infections originating from a urinary tract source of infection or biliary infections after source control", "context": "Low and high-risk infections: Based on the INCREMENT score, we defined infections (including bloodstream infections (BSI)) originating from a urinary tract source of infection or biliary infections after source control as infections at low risk for mortality and other infections as high-risk infections [10,11]."},

    {"question": "What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE?", "answer": "A carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy", "context": "For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement). We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement). We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillinclavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued."},
    {"question": "What is the most commonly reported resistance mechanism in 3GCephRE?", "answer": "Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production", "context": "The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype."},
    {"question": "What is the underlying stewardship consideration for the comparison between BLBLI and carbapenems in the treatment of 3GcephRE infections?", "answer": "The underlying stewardship consideration is the association between carbapenem use and CRE (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae).", "context": "The main comparison is between the older BLBLI (amoxicillinclavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapenems and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GcephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed."},
    {"question": "How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized?", "answer": "The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is organized by clinical syndrome, including bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, and intra-abdominal infection (IAI).", "context": "The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intraabdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3."},
    {"question": "What was the primary outcome of the MERINO trial comparing piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae?", "answer": "The primary outcome of the MERINO trial was 30-day mortality, which showed that piperacillin-tazobactam was not non-inferior to meropenem, with 30-day mortality rates of 12.3% with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 3.7% with meropenem.", "context": "BLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae [16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillintazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI e∞ to 14.5%). The risk difference was lower in the subgroup of patients with UTI (RD 3.7%, e∞ to 10.7%) than among patients with other sources of BSI (RD 14.1%, e∞ to 24.5%). Following the trial, the authors found a high rate of false susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam among OXA-1 producers with automatic methods or strip-gradient tests performed in the trial sites. A further analysis of the trial excluded patients with BSI caused by non-susceptible strains (piperacillintazobactam MIC >16 mg/L; meropenem MIC >1 mg/L CLSI, or MIC >2 mg/L EUCAST), as assessed by broth microdilution in a reference laboratory [20] The difference between groups decreased and was non-significant with a smaller sample size, mortality 13/134 (9.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 6/149 (4%) with meropenem, risk difference 5.7% (95% CI e1% to 11%). The certainty from this trial showing advantage of meropenem compared with piperacillintazobactam was classified as moderate, due to indirectness related to the high rate of OXA-1-producers with high MICs to piperacillintazobactam and to the small sample size of the further subgroup analyses. The MERINO-2 was a pilot RCT comparing piperacillintazobactam and meropenem among patients with BSI caused by presumed Amp-C b-lactamase-producing but third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Klebsiella aerogenes or Serratia marcescens [21]. Among 70 included patients, mortality was very low (two patients in the meropenem arm) and there was no significant difference in clinical failure (8/38, 21% with piperacillintazobactam versus 4/34, 12% with meropenem)."},
    {"question": "What was the overall finding of the observational studies comparing carbapenem therapy with old BLBLI for the treatment of 3GCephRE BSI?", "answer": "The observational studies showed no significant difference in mortality and other outcomes between BLBLI and carbapenems for the treatment of 3GCephRE BSI, but the evidence was limited by small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and variability in susceptibility testing methods and definitions of 3GCephRE.", "context": "A large number of observational studies compared carbapenem therapy with old BLBLI for the therapy of 3GCephRE BSI (20 studies, Table 3) [22e41]. Empirical and targeted therapies were assessed in about half of the studies each, and all reported on mortality,  variably reporting also secondary outcomes. The largest study included 365 patients for the empirical treatment and 601 patients for targeted treatment [22], but most included a few dozen patients (Table 3). None of the studies showed a significant difference between groups, except for a small study at high risk of bias showing higher unadjusted mortality with BLBLI including all Enterobacterales [41]. None of the studies were at low risk of bias; 13 were classified at moderate risk, when using an adjusted analysis with a minimal sample size allowing some adjustment and seven at high risk, mostly reporting crude associations. Hence, there is a large bulk of observational, real-life, data showing no differences in mortality and other outcomes between BLBLI and carbapenems for the treatment for 3GCephRE BSI. These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection. Different susceptibility testing methods and definitions of 3GCephRE were used in different studies. The overall certainty of the evidence for the lack of advantage for carbapenems from observational studies was judged as low for lowrisk BSI, and very low for high-risk BSI."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the retrospective observational studies comparing carbapenems with non-carbapenem antibiotics, including BLBLI, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, for the treatment of 3GCephRE infections?", "answer": "None of the studies found a significant difference in outcomes between carbapenems and non-carbapenem antibiotics, including BLBLI, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, although some studies reported a trend in favour of carbapenems or non-carbapenem-sparing antibiotics, but the evidence was limited by small sample sizes and residual differences between groups despite adjustment.", "context": "Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems and BLBLI versus non-BLBLI. Nine retrospective observational studies compared carbapenems with any other non-carbapenem antibiotic (carbapenemsparing regimen); two addressed empirical treatments and all but one analysed the targeted treatment phase [30,42e49]. The carbapenem-sparing regimens included mainly BLBLI, quinolones and aminoglycosides. Four studies reported an adjusted association and none of these found a significant outcome difference between carbapenems and non-carbapenems, but the sample sizes were small and residual differences between groups remained despite adjustment (moderate-risk to high-risk bias) [43,47e49]. Odds ratios for mortality tended in favour of carbapenems in two studies [43,49], clinical failure was in favour of non-intravenous carbapenem-sparing antibiotics in one [47] and in the largest study (249 patients receiving empirical carbapenems compared with 86 patients receiving mainly aminoglycosides), there was no significant difference between groups with respect to mortality and clinical failure [48]."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies comparing old BLBLI with a comparator regimen for the treatment of 3GCephRE BSI?", "answer": "The studies found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between old BLBLI and comparator regimens, including carbapenems or cefepime, but the evidence was limited by high risk of bias and small sample sizes, resulting in very low certainty of the evidence.", "context": "Three studies compared old BLBLI with a comparator regimen [27,42,46]. A single study using propensity score matching showed numerically better outcomes with a carbapenem or cefepime compared with piperacillin-tazobactam as targeted treatment for AmpC-b-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, but with a small sample and no statistically significant difference between groups [27]. All studies were at high risk of bias precluding inferences for this comparison. This is a small body of observational evidence further supporting no significant advantage to carbapenems in the real-life treatment of 3GCephRE BSI, but the certainty of this evidence is very low."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies comparing ertapenem with imipenem or meropenem for the treatment of BSI caused by Enterobacterales?", "answer": "The studies found no significant difference in outcomes between ertapenem and imipenem or meropenem, with one small RCT showing lower mortality with ertapenem, but the evidence was limited by moderate to high risk of bias due to differences between groups at baseline, with an overall certainty of the evidence being moderate.", "context": "Ertapenem versus imipenem/meropenem. Four observational studies [50e53] and one small RCT [54] compared ertapenem with imipenem or meropenem, mostly as targeted therapy for BSI caused by any Enterobacterales. The studies included BSI of different sources, with UTI comprising 40%e47% of the patients in all studies. The RCT included also non-bacteraemic infections and found significantly lower mortality with ertapenem [54]. The other studies did not find a significant difference between the different carbapenems. Although most reported an adjusted analysis, the risk of bias was moderate to high because there was a large difference between groups at baseline, with ertapenem used for less severe infections or prescribed as de-escalation therapy after clinical improvement in studies evaluating targeted therapy. The overall certainty of the evidence showing similar or better  [72]  outcomes for ertapenem and imipenem/meropenem for 3GCephRE BSI was moderate."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies evaluating cephamycins (cefmetazole or flomoxef) versus carbapenems for the treatment of 3GCephRE BSI?", "answer": "The studies found no significant difference in mortality between cephamycins and carbapenems, except for one study that found an association between flomoxef therapy and mortality when the MIC was elevated within the susceptible range, but the overall certainty of the evidence was very low due to limitations in study design and sample size.", "context": "Cephamycins and cefepime. Cephamycins may be active against ESBL-producing 3GcephRE. Five retrospective observational cohort studies evaluated cefmetazole or flomoxef versus carbapenems for 3GCephRE BSI (27 to 389 patients per study) [55e59]. All evaluated mortality. In the largest study including 389 patients, overall, no association was found between targeted flomoxef therapy and mortality; but when flomoxef's MIC were elevated within the susceptible range (2e8 mg/L), flomoxef was associated with mortality compared with carbapenems (adjusted OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.9e16.8) [57]. Another small study of 42 patients with dialysis access-related ESBL-Klebsiella spp. BSI showed higher mortality with targeted flomoxef compared with carbapenems, but most patients did not receive in vitro covering therapy in the first 5 days and appropriate adjustment was not possible considering the sample size [56]. The overall certainty of the evidence for a possible advantage of carbapenems over cephamycins was very low."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies evaluating cefepime versus carbapenems or non-cefepime regimens for the treatment of 3GCephRE infections?", "answer": "The studies found inconsistent results, with some studies reporting higher mortality with cefepime, particularly for ESBL infections, while others found no difference in outcomes, especially for AmpC producers, with an overall very low certainty of evidence due to high risk of bias and inconsistency across studies.", "context": "Cefepime may be active against AmpC-producing 3GcephRE. Seven retrospective observational cohort studies evaluated cefepime versus carbapenems [60e65] or a non-cefepime regimen [43]. Variation in results depending on resistance mechanism was found, with higher mortality sometimes reported with cefepime for ESBL infections and no difference in outcomes in studies specifically addressing AmpC producers. Two studies from the same group in Taiwan found an association between cefepime treatment and mortality [60,63]. In a study including 144 patients with cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacter spp. infections, overall there was no significant association, but in a very small subgroup of patients with higher cefepime MIC in the susceptible dose-dependent category, mortality was higher with cefepime (5 of 7 versus 2 of 11, p 0.045) [63]. In a study of 178 patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales BSI, definitive treatment with cefepime administered only to 17 patients was associated with higher mortality both in multivariate analysis and a propensity-score matched analysis [60]. The other studies were smaller and found no significant difference between cefepime and carbapenems or comparator antibiotics. Most studies were at high risk of bias and, considering serious inconsistency, there was very low certainty of evidence for no difference between cefepime and carbapenems or inferiority of cefepime with high MIC compared with carbapenems."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies evaluating quinolones as a treatment option for 3GCephRE BSI?", "answer": "The studies found limited evidence on targeted quinolone therapy for 3GCephRE BSI, with one study reporting an association between quinolone treatment and lower mortality, but the analysis was limited by small sample sizes and potential biases, and therefore, there is no direct evidence to support the use of quinolones for targeted therapy.", "context": "Other antibiotics. Quinolones were examined individually [42,66,67] or as part of a general comparator group [45] in five retrospective cohort studies. In a single study reporting an adjusted analysis for mortality with targeted quinolone treatment (24 patients) compared with carbapenems, quinolone treatment was associated with lower mortality [67]. The quinolone group in all studies was very small (4e24 patients) and this analysis is a priori very difficult to analyse in an observational design, because quinolones, administered orally with good bioavailability, were given as stepdown therapy to stable patients. As a result, there is no direct evidence on targeted quinolone therapy for 3GcephRE BSI, but favourable effects were observed in studies assessing Gram-negative bacteraemia in general, where a proportion of patients is expected to have had 3GcephRE BSI [68]."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies evaluating aminoglycosides as a treatment option for 3GCephRE BSI, particularly for urinary tract infections?", "answer": "The single study that reported an adjusted analysis found that aminoglycosides as targeted therapy for BSI of urinary tract source were not significantly different from carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam, but the evidence was limited by large confidence intervals and a moderate risk of bias, resulting in very-low-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment for bacteraemic UTI.", "context": "Aminoglycosides were examined specifically in a single study [69] and as part of a general comparator group in two studies [42,70]. In the single study reporting an adjusted analysis (moderate risk of bias), aminoglycosides as targeted therapy for BSI of urinary tract source were not significantly different from carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam, but with large confidence intervals [69]. Given the paucity of data and observational design, there is very-low-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment for bacteraemic UTI."},
    {"question": "What was the finding of the studies comparing intravenous fosfomycin with other antibiotics for the treatment of cUTI caused by cephalosporin-resistant or ESBL-producing Enterobacterales?", "answer": "The RCTs (ZEUS and FOREST) showed no significant differences in clinical or microbiological cure between intravenous fosfomycin and comparators (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem) in patients with cUTI, providing high-certainty evidence for the treatment of cUTI with intravenous fosfomycin, but with a consideration for safety in patients at risk for heart failure.", "context": "Intravenous fosfomycin was compared with piperacillin-tazobactam (ZEUS [71]) or meropenem (FOREST [72]) in two RCT. The ZEUS trial included patients with cUTI or acute pyelonephritis, including few patients with BSI, and the FOREST trial included patients with bacteraemic cUTI caused by E. coli. Both trials showed no significant differences in clinical or microbiological cure between intravenous fosfomycin and comparators in the subgroup of patients with cephalosporin-resistant or ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the FOREST trial, 6/70 (8.6%) patients in the intravenous fosfomycin arm developed heart failure (compared with 1/ 73 with meropenem). The trials were not powered to show noninferiority in this subgroup, but together provide high-certainty evidence for treatment of cUTI with intravenous fosfomycin, in patients without septic shock, with or without bacteraemia. Safety should be considered among patients at risk for heart failure. Oral fosfomycin was compared with ertapenem for oral stepdown or outpatient therapy in an observational study in patients with mostly complicated non-bacteraemic UTI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales [73]. The study was at high risk of bias due to the large baseline differences between groups and did not reveal a significant difference between 89 patients treated with fosfomycin and 89 treated with ertapenem (very low certainty of evidence)."},

Together with the retrospective cohort study finding no significant advantage in mortality or relapse for carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam over aminoglycosides given as targeted treatment for bacteraemic UTI (moderate risk of bias) [69], there was moderate-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment of cUTI.

Combination treatments were rarely reported in terms of individual antibiotics, dosage and duration. Criteria for patient enrolment included both phenotypic and genotypic testing, thus leading to the inclusion of strains with various patterns of antimicrobial resistance, ranging from residual susceptibility to carbapenems to pan-resistant strains. Most of the studies included infections caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and very few data were available for OXA-48 producers, MBL non-carbapenemase producers and CRE other than K. pneumoniae. Ceftazidime-avibactam. Ceftazidime-avibactam is active in vitro against Ambler class A (KPC) and certain class D (OXA-48) carbapenemases but is inactive against MBL producers. Evidence for recommending the use of ceftazidime-avibactam over other antibiotics for the treatment of CRE infections relies only on observational studies [96e100]. In a study using inverse probability of treatment weighting for adjustment of the comparison between patients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam versus those treated with colistin (before ceftazidime-avibactam was available) for CRE infections there was an overall probability for a better outcome with ceftazidime-avibactam of 64% (95% CI 57%e71%) [96]. The study included mainly CR-K. pneumoniae infections, 46% with BSI, and used an ordinal outcomes analysis (DOOR and partial credit) considering survival, discharge to home and renal failure. Concordant results were shown in another cohort of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae BSI from Italy, where patients failing previous treatment were treated with ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimens, showing higher survival in a propensity-score-adjusted analysis compared with non-ceftazidime-avibactam-based regimens [99]. Most of patients in both studies received ceftazidimeavibactam in combination with other agents. One study from Saudi Arabia retrospectively collected patients with infections caused by OXA-48 producers, showing no difference in mortality among inpatients treated with ceftazidime-avibactam compared with polymyxin-or tigecycline-containing regimens [100]."},

A total of 150 patients with proven/suspected CR-GNB infections were randomized 2:1 to receive cefiderocol versus BAT (mostly polymyxin-based combination). The trial included mainly patients with HAP/VAP and BSI and was not powered to conduct specific hypothesis testing.

A subgroup analysis of patients with MBL-producing CR-GNB infections showed statistically non-significant higher cure and microbiological eradication rates for cefiderocol (16 patients) versus BAT (seven patients), but mortality was not shown, and the analysis did not separate CRE from other CR-GNB. A post-hoc analysis by baseline pathogen revealed that the mortality difference was observed among patients with CRAB infections, but among patients with CR-K. pneumoniae, mortality at end of follow up was 6/28 (21.4%) with cefiderocol versus 4/15 (26.7%) for BAT (and 1/6 versus 0/3 for CR-E. coli, respectively) [121].

Finally, out of three additional studies assessing tigecycline or eravacycline for CRE infections of any source [131e133], a single study showed survival advantage to tigecycline compared with colistin-based therapy for CRE and/or CRAB, explained by the higher severity of patients receiving colistin [132]. Among critically ill patients with MDR-GNB infections treated with different dosages of tigecycline, the only independent predictor of clinical cure was the use of high tigecycline dose in the subgroup of patients with VAP [134]. However, more than 80% of patients in this study received concomitant active antibiotics. A higher dosage of tigecycline (200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg twice a day) in combination with other drugs was associated with non-significantly higher survival rates also in a cohort of 40 KPC-BSI compared with the standard dosage (100 mg loading dose following by 50 mg twice a day) [135]. Overall, there was low-certainty evidence for the inferiority of tigecycline compared with other antibiotics for cUTI and BSI caused by CRE.

In the few available studies with adequate sample size and adjustment for confounders, the evidence seems to favour combination over monotherapy in terms of better clinical outcomes [123,147,152,159,163,164,172,173]. This advantage emerges mainly in subgroups of patients with more severe disease and when combination is defined as regimens including more than one in vitro active antimicrobial. In a large retrospective cohort study including patients with BSI (N ¼ 447) and non-bacteraemic infections (n ¼ 214) caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in Italy, treatment including two or more in vitro active antibiotics was associated with lower 14-day mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35e0.77) [164]. In the retrospective INCREMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE BSI at high risk for death, with an INCRE-MENT score of 8e15 (n ¼ 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34e0.91). Among patients with lower INCREMENT scores (n ¼ 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56e2.56) [152]. Use of two or more in vitro active antibiotics (including colistin, tigecycline, gentamicin, carbapenems, rifampin) was independently associated with 30-day survival in retrospective study including 111 critically ill patients with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae infections and septic shock [123]. Lower efficacy of a single drug regimen with these drugs has been attributed to the often suboptimal dosage and the unsuitable pharmacokineticsepharmacodynamics profile for some infection sites [174e176]. Unfortunately, none of these studies focused on specific antibiotic combinations, so information on which antimicrobials should be included in the treatment scheme cannot be derived even from higher-certainty evidence. When looking at smaller studies analysing specific drugs, polymyxin and tigecycline seemed the antimicrobials for which the addition of a companion drug seems more advisable [143,146,147,151e153,155e157,160,161,164,167,177,178].

Nephrotoxicity was more common with colistin without statistical significance. An RCT evaluating 47 ICU patients diagnosed with CRAB VAP compared colistin and sulbactam, both combined with meropenem, with similar results [204]. A retrospective study including 167 patients with different CRAB infections, mostly in ICU and mostly with primary BSI or pneumonia, compared colistin or polymyxin B with ampicillin-sulbactam, with additional antibiotics not active in vitro in both groups [205].

All studies, except one [132], demonstrated higher mortality and lower clinical response with tigecycline monotherapy, although without statistical significance. In one study, microbiological success was significantly better with colistin [210]. In three studies, nephrotoxicity was more frequent with colistin [208e210]. Low doses of tigecycline were commonly used (50 mg twice a day), while double dosing may be more appropriate [211]. From these data, no conclusion can be drawn (no evidence). Tigecycline versus sulbactam-based therapy. A comparison between tigecycline and sulbactam has been included in five retrospective cohort studies. A single-centre, hospital-wide, retrospective study in Taiwan included 386 patients and compared tigecycline-based therapy with sulbactam-based therapy for hospital-acquired infections caused by tigecycline and sulbactam-susceptible CRAB, respectively [212]. Sulbactam was combined with imipenem, and tigecycline was prescribed variably alone or with a carbapenem or another b-lactam. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality or length of stay, but there was a significantly lower rate of clinical or microbiological failure in the tigecycline-based group. Another single-centre retrospective study in Taiwan included 84 patients with CRAB pneumonia that were matched to a historical cohort of 84 patients treated with sulbactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, mostly given in combination therapies [213]. Patients with BSI were excluded. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to 30-day mortality or clinical failure, but there was a significant advantage to sulbactam-based therapy in microbiological cure. A multicentre study in Taiwan comparing retrospectively treatment strategies among critically ill patients hospitalized in ICU with CRAB pneumonia, included a comparison between sulbactam-based combination or monotherapy (12 patients) and tigecycline monotherapy (84 patients) [214]. ICU mortality (adjusted OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01e1.02) and treatment failure (adjusted OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04e0.55) were less frequent with sulbactam-based therapy. A single-centrer retrospective study in China included 210 patients with CRAB-BSI, mostly in ICU, comparing cefoperazone-sulbactam to tigecycline, both given mostly in combination with other antibiotics [215]. The study demonstrated significantly lower 28-day mortality with sulbactam-based treatment (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34e0.94), despite the fact that 80% of the isolates were resistant to sulbactam [215]. The last study, retrospectively evaluated 274 episodes of MDR-AB-BSI hospital-wide in one centre in China, showing unadjusted lower mortality with cefoperazone-sulbactam-containing regimens compared with tigecycline-based therapy, although non-susceptibility rates to sulbactam were high [216].

There was no significant difference between colistin monotherapy and colistin-meropenem with respect to a primary composite outcome of clinical failure at day 14 or 14-day mortality overall in the randomized trial population (relative risk (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.83e1.03 for failure and RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84e1.28 for mortality with colistin monotherapy) and among patients with CRAB (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87e1.09 and RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.82e1.52, respectively). A post-hoc analysis of this trial addressed the subgroup of patients with infections caused by CRAB resistant also to colistin by broth microdilution, showing no benefit to the combination over colistin among patients with colistin-resistant CRAB [237]. The OVERCOME trial was a double-blind RCT comparing colistin monotherapy with colistin-meropenem combination for HAP/VAP and BSI caused by CR-GNB that similarly included mostly patients with CRAB of infections [179]. Mortality at 28 days was similar for colistin monotherapy 76/165 (46%) and colistin-meropenem 69/163 (42%) (p 0.5)."},

Many observational studies included patients treated with a polymyxin-carbapenem combination in a larger group of patients treated with different combination therapies. These studies mostly showed an association between combination therapy and survival, compared with polymyxin monotherapy. However, from these studies the effects of a specific combination regimen cannot be assessed."},

The combination of colistin with rifampin has been assessed in three RCT [238,240,245]. In the only powered RCT, including 209 patients with CRAB infections, mostly pneumonia, there was no advantage to colistin-rifampin over colistin monotherapy with respect to 30-day mortality [238] Microbiological cure was higher with combination therapy, but surveillance for continued carriage of CRAB was not conducted. Another small trial included 43 patients in ICU with VAP caused by CRAB, showing no difference between colistin-rifampin and colistin monotherapy with respect to in-hospital mortality and microbiological failure [245]. The third RCT included only nine patients assessing death, and clinical and microbiological response, but the lack of differences between the groups are not informative in this small sample [240]. Rifampin was included in a few patients treated with combination therapy in an observational study comparing mixed combinations with polymyxin monotherapy [248], showing no significant survival advantage to the combination.

Other combinations have been tested in single studies. Colistin-vancomycin has been assessed in a retrospective observational study among 57 patients in ICU mostly with CRAB pneumonia, compared with colistin monotherapy [239]. No difference in mortality or length of stay was observed, but there was a significantly higher rate of nephrotoxicity with the combination. In a retrospective study including critically ill patients in ICU treated with colistin-based regimens, colistin-glycopeptide combination therapy in 42 patients was not significantly different from colistin monotherapy administered to 61 patients with respect to 30-day mortality, ICU stay and hospital stay [241]. The study included a mix of MDR Gram-negative infections, most (59/103) with MDR A. baumannii. Colistin-fosfomycin was compared with colistin monotherapy in a small RCT including 94 patients with infections caused by CRAB, usually resistant to fosfomycin [228]. There was no significant difference between groups in 30-day mortality or adverse events, but combination resulted in lower microbiological failure.

    {"question": "What are the general principles for antibiotic treatment in patients with CR-GNB infections?", "answer": "The general principles include using optimal antibiotic dosing schemes, with attention to adverse effects, optimizing dosing and mode of administration by pathogen and indication, using therapeutic drug monitoring when available, prioritizing source control, and considering follow-up cultures in case of treatment failure to detect resistance development. Additionally, testing against new BLBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB resistant to all blactams, and selecting antibiotic treatment with the least resistant antibiotic/s based on MICs relative to the breakpoints is recommended for pan-resistant CR-GNB.", "context": "Optimal antibiotic dosing schemes should be used, with attention to adverse effects, especially with the old antibioticsdpolymyxins and aminoglycosides (good practice statement). Dosing and mode of administration should be optimized by pathogen and indication, with use of therapeutic drug monitoring whenever available (good practice statement). We recommend referring to EUCAST's recommended dosing (https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/). Source control should always be a priority, to optimize outcomes and shorten antibiotic treatment durations. The guidelines do not address allergies to the recommended antibiotics that should be considered before antibiotic prescription. Nebulized antibiotics were not considered in the current guideline but were addressed by an ESCMID position statement [251]. Testing against the new BLBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB that are resistant to all blactams. Follow-up cultures are recommended in case of treatment failure, especially for CR-GNB, to detect resistance development (good practice statement).

Additionally, the guideline supports antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistin and the new BLBLI, and provides good practice statements that prioritize antibiotic stewardship and can be tailored locally.", "context": "Throughout the current guideline, antibiotic stewardship considerations have been introduced. The most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy. We support antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistin (a last resort antibiotic for CRAB and MBL-producing Enterobacterales) and the new BLBLI. Many good practice statements are provided in the guidelines, when no evidence is available and clinical practice mandates decisionmaking. Many of them place a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations and can be tailored locally."},
    {"question": "What is the importance of empirical antibiotic treatment in patients at high risk for CR-GNB infections?", "answer": "Empirical antibiotic treatment is crucial in patients at high risk for CR-GNB infections, as it targets specific pathogens before pathogen identification, and a balance must be struck between achieving appropriate empirical therapy and conserving last resort therapies for these bacteria, with local guidelines guiding the empirical treatment phase based on local epidemiology.", "context": "The current guidelines address antibiotic treatment targeted to specific pathogens. Empirically, before pathogen identification, these pathogens should be targeted among patients considered at high risk for CR-GNB infections. A difficult antibiotic stewardship balance exists between achieving appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with infections due to CR-GNB and the need to conserve last resort therapies for these bacteria. The empirical treatment phase is relevant to a much larger population than targeted treatment. Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase."},
    {"question": "What are the main differences between the current guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of MDR-GNB infections?", "answer": "The main differences are the emphasis on antibiotic stewardship considerations, the consideration of alternative antibiotics to carbapenems and new BLBLI, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and aminoglycosides, and the more cautious approach to combination therapies, with a focus on the certainty of evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.", "context": "The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BLBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BLBLIs are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BLBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillinclavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BLBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes."},
    {"question": "What are the challenges and considerations for the use of new antibiotics in different settings?", "answer": "The challenges and considerations include the unequal availability of antibiotics worldwide, the high costs of new antibiotics that may prohibit their use in low-resource settings, and the need to ensure universal availability of critical antibiotics for managing priority pathogens, with efforts to address differential costs for different socio-economic settings to promote better equity in patient management.", "context": "Antibiotics, both old and new, are not equally available worldwide. In low-resource settings, costs of the new antibiotics might prohibit their use; and even in other settings costs of the new antibiotics enter the consideration for use. Antibiotics critical to management of the priority pathogens should be defined and more efforts should be implemented to ensure the universal availability of these antibiotics.

The same transplant centre included 553 LTR between 2010 and 2017 showing that CRE colonization increased significantly over time (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05(-)1.39) [34]. Multivariable analysis identified CRE colonization before transplantation as an independent risk for CRE infection (HR 18.50, 95% CI 6.76(-)50.54). Freire et al. reported 72 (40%) CRKP carriers among 181 LTR; 42% became CRKP infected compared with one out of 139 noncarriers [43]. CRKP carriers were more likely to develop an infection caused by CRKP compared with those who were colonized by other MDR-GNB (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.04-1.58). The study, however, combined pre- and post-transplant colonization. The same authors performed a study enrolling 98 (13%) LTR who were CRE carriers, showing higher rates of CRE SSIs in carriers versus noncarriers (P(=) 0.001) [13]. CRE acquisition before transplantation was identified as an independent risk factor for SSIs caused by any type of bacteria (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.43-3.77) and by MDR-GNB (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.46-6.89). Although these studies highlight an increased rate of postoperative infections among CRE carriers vs. noncarriers, several limitations were detected, including the study design (all observational single-site studies, retrospective in two cases) and the variable, or not reported, follow-up time for infection detection (Table 2)."},

Two retrospective studies, a Brazilian single-centre study and a multicentric study performed in the US and Brazil (with moderate and high risk of bias, respectively) were retrieved [13,44]. In a cohort of 762 LTR enrolled between 2010-2018, PAP was changed from 2014 replacing cefotaxime with amikacin (in association with ampicillin) if an increased risk of developing MDR infections (e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci, CRAB, and CRE) was documented [13]. Risk factors included pretransplant CRE colonization, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the past 30 days, need of dialysis, or MELD >24. A total of 229 (30%) SSIs were detected, including 109 caused by MDR bacteria. When targeted PAP was performed, the rates of SSIs caused by any MDR bacteria decreased to 13% (14/109) compared with 30% (25/120) of those caused by nonresistant bacteria (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.80). The study, however, was limited by the lack of susceptibility profiles for MDR bacteria receiving targeted PAP and by the lack of data for CRE infections, therefore the efficacy of the modified PAP could not be clearly assessed [13]. Taimur et al. [44] included 60 SOT recipients (50% liver, 28% heart, and 12% kidney transplant recipients) with either previous CRE infection or carrier status. Post-transplant CRE infections were documented in 40% of cases, and 35% SOT recipients received targeted PAP for CRE. Targeted PAP, however, was not known for most patients and mainly consisted of a combination of 2 to 3 agents such as carbapenems, polymyxin, and tigecyline. At univariable analysis, targeted PAP was more commonly reported in patients with post-SOT CRE infections (13/24, 54%) compared with those without CRE infections (8/36, 22%, P(=) 0.015). Studylimitations included the small sample size and the associated impossibility to perform a multivariable analysis. Furthermore, data on CRE colonization could not be dissected from previous CRE infection, and most patients on targeted prophylaxis had prior CRE bacteremia [44].

In colonized patients, we either reported no clear evidence for changing the usual PAP (Table 1) or provided conditional recommendation to administer PAP regimens (that are already established according to international guidelines) according to the results of preoperative cultures (Table 3). Therefore, the duration of targeted PAP should align with current recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/ASHP/SIS/SHEA) as well as other international societies that consistently give indication for PAP discontinuation within 24 hours after surgery [3,54,49,50,51,52,53,54]. No additional dosing is usually recommended for intravascular lines and devices, surgical drains, or stent placement [5,55,56]. The certainty of evidence supporting the benefits of limiting the duration of PAP to 24 hours is moderate mainly because of the high heterogeneity of studies performed in different types of surgery. The use of prolonged PAP (>24-48 hours post-inclusion) has been associated with an increased risk of antibiotic resistance, acute kidney injury, and C. difficile infection in observational studies while conferring no apparent decrease in SSIs, as shown by a meta-analysis including only RCTs and by a recent cluster randomized trial in clean orthopaedic surgery [57, 58, 59, 60].

SSIs are a common issue and may occur in 3% to 53% of SOT recipients, with highest rates observed for intestinal, liver, and pancreas transplantation [62]. LTR can develop intra-abdominal infections especially in the early post-LT period. In this group, the risk of ESC-ER and CRKP infections range from 6% to 13% and 3% and 10%, respectively, depending on the geographic area [65, 66, 67]. ESCR-E infections are common, accounting for up to 75% of MDR-GNB isolates in SOT recipients [67]. Among nonfermenters, rates of CRAB and MDR PA up to 63% and 52%, respectively, were reported in bloodstream infections (BSIs) [66,68,69].

Nevertheless, in asymptomatic SOT patients, non-outbreak settings, or in regions of endemicity the benefits of ESCR-E active surveillance are questioned [18,74]. New emerging evidence, however, showed increased rates of post-LT infections among ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB carriers before SOT [26,13,14,32,33,34,35]. Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) who were ESCR-E carriers had more frequently post-KT urinary tract infections (UTs) versus noncarriers [75]. Limited data are available for XDRPA colonization and occurrence of post-SOT infections. One prospective study in LTR showed that, out of 69 (38%) who were MDR-GNB carriers, 27% XDRPA carriers compared with 2% noncarriers developed postoperative XDRPA infections; however, most patients included in the study became colonized after LT [43], Colonization of non-CI sites, such as respiratory colonization by XDRPA in lung recipients, CRAB skin or multisite colonization inLT, or pretransplant bacteriuria in KTR may be relevant to target PAP, but data remain limited [18, 43, 46, 62, 76]."},

A worldwide survey involving lung transplant specialists reported that 67% of prescribers performed targeted PAP based on pretransplant MDR-GNB sputum colonization [76]. The AST guidelines for SSIs prevention recommend different PAP according to the type of SOT (with broader coverage for intestinal/multivisceral transplantation, lung transplantation, and delayed chest closure) and to adjust PAP in case of ongoing infections, with most recommendations being weak, with low quality evidence [18]. Targeted PAP in ESCR-E or CRE SOT carriers remains undefined, and recipient screening is recommended for lung transplant [74]. Although GESITRA recommended that ESCR-E colonized patients receive targeted PAP, no indication was given for a preferred regimen among beta-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, aminol glycosides, or carbapenems [45]. Ertapenem was mentioned as an acceptable alternative in selected ESCR-E carriers, with a recommendation to limit carbapenem-based PAP due to the risk of carbapenemases production. For CRE carriers, targeted PAP was not recommended except for centres reporting a high incidence of CRE SSIs, however a cut-off value was not provided [45]. Data comparing PAP regimens in SOT remain scarce. A study including B1S KTR found a significant reduction in SSIs when amikican was used in PAP instead of a cephalosporin [78]. Although this result could be explained by the predominance of ESCR-E SSIs, data on preoperative carriage status were not provided [78]. As previously reported, two recent retrospective studies with moderate and high risk of bias showed conflicting results on the benefit of targeted PAP in CRE carriers undergoing SOT [13, 44]."},

MDR-GNB multisite screening vs. rectal screening only should also be considered in SOT recipients before surgery to evaluate the impact on post-SOT infections according to the type of organ transplanted. Although these guidelines did not address postoperative colonization, the association between post-transplant MDR-GNB colonization and infections has often been documented, suggesting that culture surveillance should be considered also after SOT, according to the local epidemiology and individual risk factors [13, 34, 43, 48, 70, 79]."},

The use of entrapment, cefoxitin, and fosfomycin in PAP was associated to reduced incidence of BSIs in FQR-E carriers undergoing TRUSPB [88, 89, 86]. Data on TRUSPB PAP, however, are limited by a high variability in the regimens used and the short follow-up to assess infectious complications. Two single-centre observational studies performed in the US and Korea favoured targeted vs. routine PAP [90, 91]. Suwantarat et al.

    {"question": "What are the research recommendations for understanding the impact of MDR-GNB colonization on post-TRUSPB infections and assessing the efficacy of PAP regimens?", "answer": "Further studies are recommended to understand the impact of MDR-GNB colonization on post-TRUSPB infections, high-quality trials are suggested to assess the efficacy of specific PAP regimens in FQR-E carriers, and targeted PAP trials in ESCR-E carriers are recommended, with adequate monitoring of infectious complications and antibiotic resistance development.", "context": "Further studies are recommended to understand the impact of colonization with MDR-GNB other than FQR-E on post-TRUSPB infections. High-quality trials are suggested to assess the efficacy of specific PAP regimens in FQR-E carriers undergoing TRUSPB. A recommendation for research is made to design trials of targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers, especially in areas with increased ESCR-E burden. Future trials should include adequate monitoring of infectious complications and development of antibiotic resistance following surgery."},
    {"question": "Is there sufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening to inform targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for patients colonized with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) before urologic surgery?", "answer": "No, insufficient evidence is available at this time to recommend for or against screening to inform targeted PAP for patients colonized with MDR-GNB before urologic surgery.", "context": "Insufficient evidence is available at this time to recommend for or against screening to inform targeted PAP for patients who are colonized with MDR-GNB before urologic surgery (no recommendation)."},
    {"question": "What are the recommendations from the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines regarding targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for urologic surgery in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) carriers?", "answer": "The AUA guidelines suggest expanded antimicrobial coverage if PAP is required and a known history of MDR organisms is reported, while the EAU guidelines do not provide recommendations on targeted PAP due to geographic variability in bacteria, susceptibility patterns, and antibiotic availability, but recommend identifying asymptomatic bacteriuria through urine culture before surgery to reduce infectious complications and optimize antimicrobial coverage.", "context": "There is limited evidence on the impact of targeted PAP on infectious complications following urologic surgery in MDR-GNB carriers. Rectal colonization may not be informative, while urinary cultures are often obtained to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria before surgery, as recommended by clinical practice guidelines [51,102]. The 2019 American Urological Association (AUA) best practice guidelines report a high variability in prescribing PAP patterns for most urologic interventions [51]. Although targeted PAP is not routinely recommended, the AUA guidelines suggest that, if PAP is required and a known history of MDR organisms is reported, an expanded antimicrobial coverage should be warranted [51]. The EAU guidelines suggest that the identification of asymptomatic bacteriuria through urine culture before surgery aims to reduce the risk of infectious complications and to optimize antimicrobial coverage before invasive urological procedures, but do not provide recommendations on targeted PAP due to the high geographic variability in type of bacteria, susceptibility patterns, and availability of antibiotics [100]."},
    {"question": "What is the association between urinary colonization with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and postoperative infections in patients undergoing urologic surgery?", "answer": "Higher rates of postoperative infections, mainly surgical site infections (SSIs), were reported in patients with urinary colonization, particularly in ESCR-E carriers, with 31% developing postoperative infections, and 80% of these caused by the same colonizing strain.", "context": "Higher rates of postoperative infections were reported among patients with urinary colonization compared with noncolonized ones, and patients undergoing urologic surgery often have risk factors for MDR-GNB acquisition (e.g. previous surgical procedures, permanent bladder catheters, double J stents, etc.) [103,104]. Nevertheless, studies comparing postoperative infections in MDR-GNB urinary carriers versus noncarriers are lacking. A small, prospective single-centre study included 75 patients undergoing urologic surgery and receiving PAP based on the results of urine cultures (from day 2 before surgery until withdrawal of bladder catheter or until day 7) [105]. Sixteen (22%) ESCR-E carriers received targeted PAP mainly with aminoglycosides (63%), cefoxitin (19%), and imipenem (13%). Eleven (15%) postoperative infections, mainly SSIs, were detected in patients receiving targeted PAP compared with 5% in noncolonized ones (P= 0.028). A total of 31% ESCR-E carriers developed postoperative infections; 80% of these were caused by the same colonizing strain compared to 9% in noncarriers [105]."},
    {"question": "What is the research need in urologic surgery other than transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) regarding multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) colonization and targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP)?", "answer": "Further research is needed to identify the impact of MDR-GNB colonization and targeted PAP based on preoperative cultures, including urinary cultures, on postoperative infections, and to determine the optimal targeted PAP for different MDR-GNB according to the type of urological procedure and local rates of antibiotic resistance.", "context": "In urologic surgery other than TRUSPB, further research is needed to identify the impact of MDR-GNB colonization and targeted PAP based on preoperative cultures, including urinary cultures, on postoperative infections. Furthermore, the optimal targeted PAP for different MDR-GNB should be investigated according to the type of urological procedure and the local rates of antibiotic resistance."},
    {"question": "What are the limitations and knowledge gaps identified in the review of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) in surgical settings?", "answer": "The limitations and knowledge gaps include retrospective study designs, small sample sizes, lack of assessment of key outcomes, heterogeneity of surgical settings, types of PAP, and timing of assessment of postoperative infections, with most questions addressed by observational studies with high risk of bias, highlighting the need for well-done RCTs to fill in existing gaps and improve patient outcomes.", "context": "Our review has identified important knowledge gaps and limitations, including retrospective study designs, small sample sizes, lack of assessment of key outcomes, and a wide heterogeneity of surgical settings, types of PAP, and timing of assessment of postoperative infections from surgery. Most questions were addressed by observational studies with high risk of bias (Table 2 and Tables S1 and S2). Well-done RCTs are highly needed to fill in existing gaps and to improve patients' outcomes."},
    {"question": "What are the research gaps and needs in perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) carriers, particularly for extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESCR-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB)?", "answer": "Well-designed studies are needed to explore optimal PAP, including targeted PAP, for MDR-GNB carriers, investigating microbiological, epidemiological, and clinical outcomes, as well as development of resistance to antibiotics used. Research gaps include the impact of carrier status for MDR-GNB other than ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB, such as XDRPA and PDR-GNB colonization, and the potential for resistance selection and side effects with antibiotic combinations.", "context": "For ESCR-E and CRE carriers, increased evidence recently highlighted the association between rectal colonization and postoperative infections, supporting surveillance screening for MDR-GNB, especially in areas with high burden and for high-risk surgery, suggesting that targeted PAP may be effective in reducing SSIs. No RCTs, however, were performed comparing targeted with routine PAP in MDR-GNB carriers. Furthermore, routine prophylaxis may vary according to local protocols and different geographic areas, potentially impacting SSIs. One prospective multinational study showed a potential benefit for etapenem use in ESCR-E carriers undergoing colorectal surgery [41]. Previously, etapenem-based PAP was used in studies not reporting colonization data, showing SSIs reduction in a retrospective study including 615 cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery [106], while a RCT including 499 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery reported similar efficacy for etapenem versus routine PAP [107]. Because of the limited options currently available to effectively treat MDR-GNB, well-designed studies exploring optimal PAP are needed. These trials should investigate the impact of targeted PAP on microbiological, epidemiological, and clinical outcomes as well as development of resistance to the antibiotics used for targeted regimens. Antibiotic type and dosing should be chosen according to PK/PD principles and considering the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Few studies have explored the impact of carrier status for MDR-GNB other than ESCR-E, CRE, and CRAB. XDRPA as well as PDR-GNB colonization effects on SSIs need further attention, as colonization rates by these bacteria are likely to increase in the future. If PAP including antibiotic combinations (e.g. two or more antibiotics with in vitro efficacy against MDR-GNB) are investigated, efforts should be made to analyse their potential for resistance selection and side effects."},
    {"question": "What are the research gaps and needs in antibiotic-based interventions for reducing postsurgical infections in multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) carriers, including decolonization, selective digestive decontamination (SDD), and oral antibiotic therapy?", "answer": "There is a need for clinical trials exploring antibiotic-based interventions, such as decolonization, SDD, and oral antibiotic therapy, specifically targeting MDR-GNB carriers before surgery, as well as bundled interventions complementing perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP), and metagenomic studies assessing the effect of antibiotic treatment on microbiota composition and colonization dynamics.", "context": "Other antibiotic-based interventions for reducing postsurgical infections (e.g. decolonization, SDD) and targeting MDR-GNB carriers before surgery have not been explored in clinical trials. The ENTHERE study group performed an open-label, multicenter RCT treating 53 SOI recipients who were MDR-GNB carriers with oral colistin plus neomycin, while 52 did not receive the decontamination protocol. No significant difference in infections due to MDR Enterobacterales was observed between groups, however patients enrolled were colonized not only before (58%) but also after SOT (42%) [108], SDD with oral colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B was performed in a RCT in colorectal surgery showing a reduction of postoperative infections in the SDD arm compared to controls, nevertheless carrier status was not tested [109]. Since recent trials in colorectal surgery showed that the use of oral antibiotics (with or without mechanical bowel preparation) may reduce the risk of SSIs, protocols exploring the use of oral therapy with activity on MDR-GNB should be considered [110,111]. While coordinated actions (e.g., decolonization, active surveillance, and stewardship measures) seemed to contribute to SSIs reduction for MDR Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, no bundles complementing PAP in MDR-GNB carriers undergoing surgery were found [112]. Metagenomic studies assessing the effect of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota composition and on patients' colonization dynamics over time should be investigated within new protocols or bundled interventions targeting MDR-GNB."},
    {"question": "What is the comprehensive approach required to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs)?", "answer": "A comprehensive approach to reduce SSIs requires a combination of antibiotic-based interventions, such as targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP), and best surgical practices, including minimization of surgical operative time, regulation of glucose and temperature, optimization of sterile techniques, and management of patient comorbidities, as well as heightening stewardship initiatives, enhancing surveillance protocols, improving local adherence to guidelines, and promoting a multidisciplinary approach.", "context": "The reduction of SSIs requires a comprehensive approach in terms of antibiotic-based interventions and best surgical practices (e.g. minimization of surgical operative time, regulation of glucose and temperature, optimization of sterile techniques, and management of patient comorbidities) [49,59,113].

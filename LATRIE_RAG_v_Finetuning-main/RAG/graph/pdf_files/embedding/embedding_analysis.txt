Comparison of two embedding models:
- BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
- NeuML/pubmedbert-base-embeddings

BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 : general embedding model

NeuML/pubmedbert-base-embeddings : PubMedBERT Embeddings produces higher quality embeddings than generalized models for medical literature. 

We observed similar results with the two models, and sometimes worse results for the METEOR score for the second model, which is surprising (see paper).

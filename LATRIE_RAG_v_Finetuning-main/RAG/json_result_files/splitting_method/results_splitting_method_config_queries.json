Definition of MDR-GNB: The current guidelines use a more comprehensive definition of MDR-GNB, which includes organisms that are resistant to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes.

Definition of MDR-GNB: The current guidelines use a more comprehensive definition of MDR-GNB, which includes organisms that are resistant to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes.

Rapid and accurate diagnostic methods, such as molecular methods and mass spectrometry, are needed to enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n2.

Definition of MDR-GNB: The current guidelines use a more comprehensive definition of MDR-GNB, which includes organisms that are resistant to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes.

More large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively determine the superiority or equivalence of plazomicin versus colistin in the treatment of CRE infections.

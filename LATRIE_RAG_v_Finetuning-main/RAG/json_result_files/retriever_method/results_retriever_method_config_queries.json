Additionally, testing against new BLBLI and polymyxins is recommended for CR-GNB resistant to all blactams, and selecting antibiotic treatment with the least resistant antibiotic/s based on MICs relative to the breakpoints is recommended for pan-resistant CR-GNB.",

FQR carriers had a 6.2-fold higher risk of early postbiopsy infection compared to noncarriers. However, the data are limited by the non-blinded design and the short follow-up to assess infectious complications.",

High-quality trials are suggested to assess the efficacy of specific PAP regimens in FQR-E carriers undergoing TRUSPB.\n3. A recommendation for research is made to design trials of targeted PAP in ESCR-E carriers, especially in areas with increased ESCR-E burden.\n4. Future trials should include adequate monitoring of infectious complications and development of antibiotic resistance following surgery.\n5",

Wide heterogeneity of surgical settings, types of PAP, and timing of assessment of postoperative infections\n5. High risk of bias in most observational studies\n6. Important knowledge gaps on the impact of MDR-GNB colonization and targeted PAP on postoperative infections\n7.

        "reference context": "For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement). We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement). We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillinclavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.",

        "reference context": "For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement). We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement). We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillinclavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.",

For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement). We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement). We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillinclavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.",

These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection.

For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement). We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement). We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence). For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillinclavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.",

It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement)."

In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype."

Five retrospective observational cohort studies evaluated cefmetazole or flomoxel versus carbapenems for 3GCephRE BSI (27 to 389 patients per study) [55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. All evaluated mortality. In the largest study including 389 patients, overall, no association was found between targeted flomoxel therapy and mortality; but when flomoxel's MIC were elevated within the susceptible range (2-8 mg/L), flomoxel was associated with mortality compared with carbapenems (adjusted OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.9-16.8) [57]. Another small study of 42 patients with dialysis access-related ESBL-Klebsiella spp. BSI showed higher mortality with targeted flomoxel compared with carbapenems, but most patients did not receive in vitro covering therapy in the first 5 days and appropriate adjustment was not possible considering the sample size [56]."

            "Empirical antibiotic treatment is crucial in patients at high risk for CR-GNB infections, as it targets specific pathogens before pathogen identification, and a balance must be struck between achieving appropriate empirical therapy and conserving last resort therapies for these bacteria, with local guidelines guiding the empirical treatment phase based on local epidemiology.",
            "The main differences are the emphasis on antibiotic stewardship considerations, the consideration of alternative antibiotics to carbapenems and new BLBLI, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and aminoglycosides, and the more cautious approach to combination therapies, with a focus on the certainty of evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.",
            "The challenges and considerations include the unequal availability of antibiotics worldwide, the high costs of new antibiotics that may prohibit their use in low-resource settings, and the need to ensure universal availability of critical antibiotics for managing priority pathogens, with efforts to address differential costs for different socio-economic settings to promote better equity in patient management.",

            "The limitations were that Apisarnthanarak et al. did not provide a comparison with other PAP, and De Patena et al. did not select PAP according to preoperative cultures and allowed prolonged PAP in certain cases, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of targeted PAP.",
            "The level of certainty of evidence is low for colorectal surgery and very low for liver transplant surgery, but despite this, the panel suggests considering targeted PAP as a good practice for all solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to the high risk of infections and available evidence for liver transplant surgery.",

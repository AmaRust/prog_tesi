The studies assessing each syndrome are described in Table 3. For example, the evidence on BSI includes the MERINO trial comparing piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with 3GCephRE BSI. The evidence is also organized by antibiotic comparisons, such as BLBLI versus carbapenems, and discusses the conflict between the MERINO trial and observational data. Additionally, the evidence addresses the use of specific antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, intravenous fosfomycin, and tigecycline, for",

The evidence for aminoglycoside treatment for bacteriaemic UTI is also very-low-certainty due to the paucity of data and observational design.",

However, the study was limited by a small sample size and lack of adjustment for confounding factors. No other RCTs specifically addressing IAI caused by 3GCephRE were identified in the context provided.",

However, it is important to note that the evidence is insufficient for other comparisons and other sources of infection. The studies that have been conducted have shown conflicting results, with some studies suggesting an advantage of aminoglycosides over tigecycline, while others have shown no significant difference or even an advantage of tigecycline. The evidence is also limited by the observational design and small sample sizes of many of the studies. Therefore, more research is needed to establish the definitive role of aminoglycosides versus tigecycline in the treatment of cUTI.",

However, it is important to note that the evidence is of moderate certainty due to the limitations of the studies, including the small number of patients with CRE infections and the heterogeneity of the patient populations.

This recommendation is conditional with low certainty of evidence for both CRE and CRAB.

                "The evidence for the advantage of aminoglycosides over tigecycline for cUTI is moderate. The CRaCKle cohort studies suggest better clinical outcomes with aminoglycoside-containing regimens compared with tigecycline-containing regimens. However, there is insufficient evidence for other comparisons and sources of infection.",
                "Based on the context provided, there is low-certainty evidence for an advantage of high-dose extended-infusion meropenem-polymyxin combination therapy over polymyxin monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections caused by CRE, mainly KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest a difference in 28-day mortality between colistin monotherapy and colistin-carbapenem combination therapy specifically. The AIDA and OVERCOME trials did not show statistically significant differences in 28-day mortality between colistin monotherapy and colistin-carbapenem combination therapy in patients with CRE infections. However, in the retrospective Italian cohort study, combination therapy including a carbapenem was associated with lower 14-day",
                "The retrospective cohort study reported higher clinical care (adjusted OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.31-5.30) and lower nephrotoxicity (adjusted OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.22) with ceftolozane-tazobactam compared with polymyxins or aminoglycosides in patients with MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa mixed infections.",

                "There have been several observational studies assessing the effectiveness of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy for CRAB infections. Some studies showed a significant association between the use of the combination and survival or clinical cure [198, 235, 247]. However, other studies did not show such an association [199, 244]. It is important to note that many of these studies included patients treated with a polymyxin-carbapenem combination in a larger group of patients treated with different combination therapies. Therefore, the effects of a specific combination regimen cannot be definitively assessed from these studies alone.\n\n        Overall, the evidence from observational studies on the effectiveness of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy for CRAB infections is conflicting and of low to very low certainty.

                "Based on the context provided, the suggested screening approach for patients undergoing colorectal and liver transplant surgery is to perform rectal screening to identify Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCR-E) carriers before these surgeries, according to local epidemiology (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). It might also be a good practice to screen all SOT recipients for ESCR-E before surgery according to local epidemiology (ungraded good practice statement). Similar recommendations apply for Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) carriers in liver transplant patients, according to local epidemiology (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and it might be a good practice to screen all",

                "Based on the current evidence, a conditional recommendation for targeted PAP in patients colonized with CRE undergoing liver transplant surgery can be issued (low certainty of evidence). It might also be a good practice to consider targeted PAP for all SOT recipients who are colonized with CRE before surgery (ungraded good practice statement). However, the choice of targeted PAP should take into consideration the limited number of options available for the treatment of CRE infections, avoiding novel compounds that may be required for the treatment of postsurgical infections. Resistance monitoring should be performed after surgery to detect emerging resistance to the regimens used for targeted PAP.",
                "The panel suggests designing clinical trials comparing the incidence risk of CRAB infections in carriers versus noncarriers, especially for patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Additionally, the efficacy of targeted versus routine PAP in CRAB carriers should be investigated in clinical trials.",
                "The risk of MDR-GNB infections in SOT recipients ranges from 3% to 53%, with the highest rates observed for intestinal, liver, and pancreas transplantation. Post-SOT infections caused by MDR-GNB are associated with higher mortality compared with their susceptible counterpart. Among non-fermenters, rates of CRAB and MDR PA infections can be up to 63% and 52%, respectively, in bloodstream infections. ESCR-E infections are common, accounting for up to 75% of MDR-GNB isolates in SOT recipients. Limited data are available for XDRPA colonization and occurrence of post-SOT infections.

FQR carriers had a 6.2-fold higher risk of early postbiopsy infection compared to noncarriers. However, the trial did not identify an optimal targeted PAP for FQR-E carriers.",
                "A comprehensive approach to reduce SSIs requires a focus on both antibiotic-based interventions and best surgical practices. This includes minimizing surgical operative time, regulating glucose and temperature, optimizing sterile techniques, and managing patient comorbidities. Additionally, heightening stewardship initiatives to monitor and contain the consequences of new prescription patterns, enhancing surveillance protocols, improving local adherence to guidelines, and promoting a multidisciplinary approach are essential. The optimization of antibiotic-based interventions should not only target specific pathogens but also consider the potential impact on the microbiome and patient colonization dynamics over time.",

Antibiotic stewardship considerations, including the use of monotherapy versus combination therapy and the importance of avoiding carbapenem-based combinations unless necessary\n6. Resistance monitoring and investigation of short- and long-term colonization after surgery.\n\nIt is important to note that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend targeted PAP for CRE carriers, but the knowledge of their colonization status is still relevant for infection control purposes and for the adaptation of postsurgical empirical treatment.

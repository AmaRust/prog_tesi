For instance, Dubinsky-Perretoor et al. reported significantly higher rates of SSIs in ESCR-E carriers compared with noncarriers (24.8% vs. 11.1%, P < 0",

Studies analyzing the optimal timing for preoperative screening to minimize the risk of postoperative infections caused by MDR-GNB are also recommended.

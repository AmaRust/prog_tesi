        "context": "Context:\nThe main comparison is between the older BLBII (amoxicillin- clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapemens and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.\nThe evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.\nBloodstream infections\nBLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae[16].\n\nThe largest study included 365 patients for the empirical treatment and 601 patients for targeted treatment [22], but most included a few dozen patients (Table 3). None of the studies showed a significant difference between groups, except for a small study at high risk of bias showing higher unadjusted mortality with BLBI including all Enterobacterales [41]. None of the studies were at low risk of bias; 13 were classified at moderate risk, when using an adjusted analysis with a minimal sample size allowing some adjustment and seven at high risk, mostly reporting crude associations. Hence, there is a large bulk of observational, real-life, data showing no differences in mortality and other outcomes between BLBI and carbenemens for the treatment for 3GCphRE BSI. These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection.

        "context": "Context:\nThird-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae\nQuestion 1.1: What is the antibiotic of choice for 3GCephRE\nRecommendations\n\nFor patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).\nFor patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).\nFor patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement).\nFor cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous foafymycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence).\nAmong all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).\nWe do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).\nAmong all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement).\nWe suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).\nFor cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.\n\nReview of the evidence\nThe data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. \n\nThe most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy. We support antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistian (a last resort antibiotic for CRAB and MBL-producing Enterobacterales) and the new BIBLI. Many good practice statements are provided in the guidelines, when no evidence is available and clinical practice mandates decision-making. \n\nLocal guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.\n\n\nOnly RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed. Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. \n\nFor 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.\nThe evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.\n\n\n",

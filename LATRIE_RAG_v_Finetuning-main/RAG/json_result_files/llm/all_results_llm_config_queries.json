                " When designing clinical trials of targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP), several key considerations should be taken into account to ensure the validity, reliability, and applicability of the study results. These considerations include:\n\n1. Clearly defined objectives: The primary goal",
                " When choosing targeted perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections, several factors should be considered:\n\n1. Preoperative screening: Implementing rectal screening to identify CRE carriers before surgery is recommended, especially for high-risk surgeries such as liver transplant surgery.\n\n2",
                " Resistance monitoring in the context of targeted PAP for MDR-GNB aims to track the development of resistance to the antibiotics used in the prophylactic regimen. This is crucial to ensure the continued effectiveness of the antibiotics and to prevent the emergence and spread of further resistance. Monitoring helps in identifying any changes in the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria, which can inform adjustments to the PAP regimen to maintain its efficacy. It also aids in understanding the impact of targeted PAP on resistance development,",
                " Screen all SOT recipients for CRE before surgery based on local prevalence.",
                " Consider local epidemiology and patient-related risk factors.",
                " The choice between targeted and universal screening for MDR-GNB should be based on local work organization and integrated within antibiotic and diagnostic stewardship guidance.",
                " Knowing the colonization status of a patient before solid organ transplantation (SOT) is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps in identifying patients at risk of post-transplant infections, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB). These infections can lead to increased morbidity and mortality among SOT recip"

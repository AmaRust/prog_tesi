* 4 chunks retrieved for the query : "What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE?"

- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.4914858341217041):
The most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy. We support antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistin (a last resort antibiotic for CRAB and MBL-producing Enterobacterales) and the new BLBLI. Many good practice statements are provided in the guidelines, when no evidence is available and clinical practice mandates decisionmaking. Many of them place a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations and can be tailored locally.
The current guidelines address antibiotic treatment targeted to specific pathogens. Empirically, before pathogen identification, these pathogens should be targeted among patients considered at high risk for CR-GNB infections.

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.48881566524505615):
(b) Should combination antibiotic therapy be used for patients infected with the target CR-GNB?
The recommendations are summarized in Table

head : Conditional Moderate
For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones. It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe cUTI.

head : Methods
First, a systematic review was performed to support the recommendations. The certainty of the evidence was classified using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Second, an expert panel translated the evidence to recommendations and the strength of recommendations was adjudicated. Finally, the recommendations were discussed and revised until consensus was achieved and the final list of recommendations was formally approved by the whole panel. The review protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement

A guideline panel was convened by the ESCMID Executive Committee in 2018.

- CHUNK 3 (similarity : 0.4608001112937927):
For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement). For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous fosfomycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence) Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).

- CHUNK 4 (similarity : 0.42376798391342163):
All and only panel members participated in the eligibility assessment and data extraction.

head : Data synthesis and development of recommendations
Because of the large, expected heterogeneity of study designs, treatment schemes, patient populations and resistance definitions the expert panel agreed not to perform quantitative synthesis of the data using meta-analysis and results were summarized qualitatively. When possible, recommendations tried to address severe infections versus others, at-risk infection sources versus others and different mechanisms of resistance. Available evidence for each treatment comparison was classified by the panel following the GRADE system

head : Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales
Question 1.1: What is the antibiotic of choice for 3GCephRE

head : Recommendations
For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence). For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).

* The prompt we are going to use without additional prompt and context is :

[INST] What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

For patients with bacteremia (BSI, or bloodstream infection) and severe infection caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Enterobacterales (3GCephalosporin-resistant, 3GCephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy depends on the susceptibility profile of the isolate and local guidelines.

Here are some common options:

1. Carbapenems: Carbapenems, such as meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem, are often used as first-line agents for treating infections caused by 3GCephrE due to their broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases

What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? 
[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

For patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) and severe infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3GCephrasporin-resistant, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy is usually a carbapenem antibiotic. Examples include meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem. These antibiotics can effectively cover against 3GCephrE producing bacteria and have good penetration into the bacterial cell wall. However, it's essential to consider local resistance patterns and individual patient factors before making a definitive treatment decision. Always consult with an infectious disease specialist for the most accurate information.

* 3 chunks retrieved for the query : "What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE?"

- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.4607957601547241):
 Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are
reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and there-
fore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for
infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship
considerations (good practice statement).
 We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, ﬂo-
moxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections
(conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty
of evidence).
 For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-
clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufﬁcient
evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE
infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommen-
dation can be issued.
Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from
observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with
BSI and urinary source of infection.

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.4473845660686493):
It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe cUTI.
Conditional/good practice statement
Moderate/expert opinion
For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when
active in vitro for short durations of therapy, or IV fosfomycin.
Conditional/strong
Moderate/high
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following
carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old BLBLI, quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other
antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice.

We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by 3GCephRE.

* The prompt we are going to use without additional prompt and context is :

[INST] What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

For patients with bacteremia (BSI, or bloodstream infection) and severe infection caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Enterobacterales (3GCephalosporin-resistant, 3GCephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy depends on the susceptibility profile of the isolate and local guidelines.

Here are some common options:

1. Carbapenems: Carbapenems, such as meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem, are often used as first-line agents for treating infections caused by 3GCephrE due to their broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases

What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? 
[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

For patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) and severe infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3GCephrasporin-resistant, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy is usually a carbapenem antibiotic. Examples include meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem. These antibiotics can effectively cover against 3GCephrE producing bacteria and have good penetration into the bacterial cell wall. However, it's essential to consider local resistance patterns and individual patient factors before making a definitive treatment decision. Always consult with an infectious disease specialist for the most accurate information.

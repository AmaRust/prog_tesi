* 4 chunks retrieved for the query : "How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized?"

- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.4864215850830078):
The most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy. We support antibiotic stewardship considerations when using colistian (a last resort antibiotic for CRAB and MBL-producing Enterobacterales) and the new BIBLI. Many good practice statements are provided in the guidelines, when no evidence is available and clinical practice mandates decision-making. 

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.43993884325027466):
Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.


- CHUNK 3 (similarity : 0.42986947298049927):
Only RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed. Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. 

- CHUNK 4 (similarity : 0.3433762192726135):
For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.

* The prompt we are going to use without additional prompt and context is :

[INST] How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

The evidence on the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) is organized through various sources, including peer-reviewed scientific journals, clinical guidelines, and meta-analyses. Here are some ways the evidence is typically organized:

1. Peer-reviewed scientific journals: Research studies on the treatment of infections caused by 3GCs are published in scientific journals. These studies can be categorized based on their study design, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, or systematic reviews. RCTs are considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments, while observational studies can provide valuable real-world data on how a treatment is used in clinical practice.
2. Clinical guidelines: Clinical guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment

[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

The evidence on the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria (3GCRE) is organized through numerous studies, meta-analyses, and guidelines from reputable medical organizations and journals. These sources provide evidence on the effectiveness and safety of various treatment options, including specific antibiotics and combinations, for different types of 3GCRE infections. It is important to note that the evidence is constantly evolving as new research emerges, and healthcare professionals should stay updated on the latest guidelines and recommendations. Some commonly referenced sources include the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and major medical journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet.

The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is organized by clinical syndrome. The context above mentions that the evidence is provided for bacteremia (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, and intra-abdominal infections (IAI). The text also states that all studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3. The guidelines stress the importance of considering alternatives to carbapenems and new BIBLI, and stratifying patients by sepsis severity when making treatment decisions. The evidence is also presented in the context of local epidemiology and antibiotic stewardship considerations.

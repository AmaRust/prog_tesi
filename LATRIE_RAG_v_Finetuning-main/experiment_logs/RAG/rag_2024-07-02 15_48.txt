conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence

strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence

Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (

We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (
strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence

Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.4304395318031311):
The quinolone group in all studies was very small (4-24 patients) and this analysis is a priori very difficult to analyse in an observational design, because quinolones, administered orally with good bioavailability, were given as stepdown therapy to stable patients. As a result, there is no direct evidence on targeted quinolone therapy for 3GcephRE BSI, but favourable effects were observed in studies assessing Gram-negative bacteriaemia in general, where a proportion of patients is expected to have had 3GcephRE BSI [68].
Aminoglycosides were examined specifically in a single study [69] and as part of a general comparator group in two studies [42,70]. In the single study reporting an adjusted analysis (modernate risk of bias), aminoglycosides as targeted therapy for BSI of urinary tract source were not significantly different from carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam, but with large confidence intervals [69]. Given the paucity of data and observational design, there is very-low-certainty evidence for aminoglycoside treatment for bacteriaemic UTI.
Complicated urinary tract infections with or without bacteriaemia.

Recommendations
For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (
strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence

For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (
conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence

For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (

[INST] What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

For patients with bacteremia (BSI, or bloodstream infection) and severe infection caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Enterobacterales (3GCephalosporin-resistant, 3GCephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy depends on the susceptibility profile of the isolate and local guidelines.

Here are some common options:

1. Carbapenems: Carbapenems, such as meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem, are often used as first-line agents for treating infections caused by 3GCephrE due to their broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases

What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? 
[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

For patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) and severe infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3GCephrasporin-resistant, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy is usually a carbapenem antibiotic. Examples include meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem. These antibiotics can effectively cover against 3GCephrE producing bacteria and have good penetration into the bacterial cell wall. However, it's essential to consider local resistance patterns and individual patient factors before making a definitive treatment decision. Always consult with an infectious disease specialist for the most accurate information.

- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.5756357908248901):
In the retrospective INCEMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE ISI at high risk for death, with an INKEMENT score of 8-15 (n = 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Among patients with lower INCEMENT scores (n = 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56-2.56) [152]. Use of two or more in vitro active antibiotics (including colistin, tiegycline, gentamicin, carbapenems, rifampicin) was independently associated with 30-day survival in retrospective study including 111 critically ill patients with KPC-producing (K). pneumoniae infections and septic shock [123]. Lower efficacy of a single drug regimen with these drugs has been attributed to the often suboptimal dosage and the unsuitable pharmacokinetics--pharmacodynamics profile for some infection sites [174, 175, 176]. Unfortunately, none of these studies focused on specific antibiotic combinations, so information on which antimicrobials should be included in the treatment scheme cannot be derived even from higher-certainty evidence. When looking at smaller studies analysing specific drugs, polymyxin and tiegycline seemed the antimicrobials for which the addition of a companion drug seems more advisable [143, 146, 147, 151, 152, 153, 155, 157, 160, 161, 164, 167, 177, 178]. Due to the high heterogeneity of treatment included, even in smaller studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn on which companion drug should be preferred when prescribing polymyxin and tiegycline, but treatment with more than one in vitro active antibiotic might be beneficial (moderate-certainty evidence).
Carbapenem combination therapy
The inclusion of a carbapenem in the combination scheme for treating carbapenem-resistant infections has been a long-standing matter of debate. Two investigator-initiated RCT, the AIDA and OVERCOME trials, evaluated the efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-meropenem combination therapy in patients with severe infections caused by CR-GNB, mainly HAP/VAP and BSI [160, 179].

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.5743790864944458):
Other carbapenem-sparing treatments were evaluated in several studies. Carbapenems versus BLBLI were evaluated in one RCT [32] at high risk of bias due to small sample size and baseline differences between groups and several observational studies (moderate to high risk of bias) [28,33,35]. All studies evaluated the targeted treatment of pyelonephritis and assessed variable clinical and microbiological cure and mortality; one study assessed relapse and resistance selection [35]. None of the studies found statistically significant differences between BLBLI and carbapenems, supporting moderate-certainty evidence for BLBLI in the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.
Cephamycins and cefepime were compared with carbapenems in several retrospective cohort studies [76, 77, 78, 79]. None found statistically significant differences between groups, in very small sample sizes (the cephalosporin group ranging from 10 to 23 patients). All studies were at high risk of bias, together providing low-certainty evidence for cepamymcins and cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.
Temocillin provided for more than 50% of the time of effective antibiotic therapy duration was compared with carbapenems in a matched case--control study (144 patients) [80]. The study showed no significant difference between treatment groups in clinical cure, relapse and mortality, but despite matching there were significant differences between groups that were not adjusted for, and the confidence intervals were large, providing very low-certainty evidence for temocillin in cUTI.
Finally, two retrospective studies did not reveal significant differences in clinical cure and microbiological outcomes between carbapenems and any non-carbapenem antibiotic, with high risk of 
[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]
therapy occurred in up to 3.7%-8.1% of ceftazidime-avibactam-treated patients [101,108]. More recently in Greece, a novel plasmid-borne Vietnamese extended-spectrum b-lactamase (VEB)-25 has been described in ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant CR-K. pneumoniae strains, independent of ceftazidime-avibactam exposure [109].

The optimization of antibiotic-based interventions should focus not only on targeted PAP but also on heightening stewardship initiatives to monitor and contain the consequences of new prescription patterns, enhance surveillance protocols, improve local adherence to guidelines, and promote a multidisciplinary approach to target SSIs [114].

A large number of observational studies compared carbapenem therapy with old BLBII for the therapy of 3GCephRE BSI (20 studies, Table 3) [22-41], Empirical and targeted therapies were assessed in about half of the studies each, and all reported on mortality,
[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]
variably reporting also secondary outcomes. The largest study included 365 patients for the empirical treatment and 601 patients for targeted treatment [22], but most included a few dozen patients (Table 3). None of the studies showed a significant difference between groups, except for a small study at high risk of bias showing higher unadjusted mortality with BLBI including all Enterobacterales [41]. None of the studies were at low risk of bias; 13 were classified at moderate risk, when using an adjusted analysis with a minimal sample size allowing some adjustment and seven at high risk, mostly reporting crude associations. Hence, there is a large bulk of observational, real-life, data showing no differences in mortality and other outcomes between BLBI and carbenemens for the treatment for 3GCphRE BSI. These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection. Different susceptibility testing methods and definitions of 3GCphRE were used in different studies. The overall certainty of the evidence for the lack of advantage for carbenemens from observational studies was judged as low for low-risk BSI, and very low for high-risk BSI.
Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems and BLBI versus non-BLBI. Nine retrospective observational studies compared carbapenems with any other non-carbapenem antibiotic (carbapenem-sparing regimen); two addressed empirical treatments and all but one analysed the targeted treatment phase [30,42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. The carbapenem-sparing regimens included mainly BLBI, quinolones and aminoglycosides.

Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
Question 1.1: What is the antibiotic of choice for 3GCephRE
Recommendations

For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).
For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).
For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement).
For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous foafymycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).
We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement).
We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).

- CHUNK 6 (similarity : 0.4834440350532532):
Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. Investigator-initiated RCT are needed addressing these gaps. Concomitantly, observational studies can include a broader and larger patient population and with improved methods to reduce bias can portray the real life and support decision-making. Antibiotic treatments addressed as the exposures in existing studies were frequently combined with other antibiotics, switched and crossed; study designs allowing a cleaner assessment of individual antibiotics or specific combinations are needed. Studies addressing targeted treatment should address the empirical antibiotic treatment and report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of the isolated bacteria to direct more individualized treatment. The ecological impact of different treatment strategies should be evaluated.
Evidence is lacking on the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics (e.g. pivmecilliam, fosfomycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), for initial treatment of clinically stable patients with UTI or as oral follow up, compared with continued definitive intravenous therapy. Furthermore, more studies are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens (dose, frequency, intermittent or prolonged administration) and treatment durations especially when using b-lactam antibiotics.

For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.

Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype. The main comparison is between the older BLBII (amoxicillin- clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapemens and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.
Bloodstream infections
BLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae[16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI -o to 14.5%).

Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.
Considering costs and equity
Antibiotics, both old and new, are not equally available worldwide. In low-resource settings, costs of the new antibiotics might prohibit their use; and even in other settings costs of the new antibiotics enter the consideration for use. Antibiotics critical to management of the priority pathogens should be defined and more efforts should be implemented to ensure the universal availability of these antibiotics. Differential costs of the new antibiotics for different socio-economic settings will allow better equity of patient management.
Research needs
Recommendations for further research were not developed formally and were not graded. Most recommendations in the guideline are based on very-low-certainty evidence or no evidence. Only RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed.

* GLOBAL CONTEXT:

Context:
In the retrospective INCEMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE ISI at high risk for death, with an INKEMENT score of 8-15 (n = 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Among patients with lower INCEMENT scores (n = 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56-2.56) [152]. Use of two or more in vitro active antibiotics (including colistin, tiegycline, gentamicin, carbapenems, rifampicin) was independently associated with 30-day survival in retrospective study including 111 critically ill patients with KPC-producing (K). pneumoniae infections and septic shock [123]. Lower efficacy of a single drug regimen with these drugs has been attributed to the often suboptimal dosage and the unsuitable pharmacokinetics--pharmacodynamics profile for some infection sites [174, 175, 176]. Unfortunately, none of these studies focused on specific antibiotic combinations, so information on which antimicrobials should be included in the treatment scheme cannot be derived even from higher-certainty evidence. When looking at smaller studies analysing specific drugs, polymyxin and tiegycline seemed the antimicrobials for which the addition of a companion drug seems more advisable [143, 146, 147, 151, 152, 153, 155, 157, 160, 161, 164, 167, 177, 178]. Due to the high heterogeneity of treatment included, even in smaller studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn on which companion drug should be preferred when prescribing polymyxin and tiegycline, but treatment with more than one in vitro active antibiotic might be beneficial (moderate-certainty evidence).

Two investigator-initiated RCT, the AIDA and OVERCOME trials, evaluated the efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-meropenem combination therapy in patients with severe infections caused by CR-GNB, mainly HAP/VAP and BSI [160, 179].

The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI -o to 14.5%).

Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.
Considering costs and equity
Antibiotics, both old and new, are not equally available worldwide. In low-resource settings, costs of the new antibiotics might prohibit their use; and even in other settings costs of the new antibiotics enter the consideration for use. Antibiotics critical to management of the priority pathogens should be defined and more efforts should be implemented to ensure the universal availability of these antibiotics. Differential costs of the new antibiotics for different socio-economic settings will allow better equity of patient management.
Research needs
Recommendations for further research were not developed formally and were not graded. Most recommendations in the guideline are based on very-low-certainty evidence or no evidence. Only RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed.

The evidence on the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) is organized through various sources, including peer-reviewed scientific journals, clinical guidelines, and meta-analyses. Here are some ways the evidence is typically organized:

1. Peer-reviewed scientific journals: Research studies on the treatment of infections caused by 3GCs are published in scientific journals. These studies can be categorized based on their study design, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, or systematic reviews. RCTs are considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments, while observational studies can provide valuable real-world data on how a treatment is used in clinical practice.
2. Clinical guidelines: Clinical guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment

    Context:
In the retrospective INCEMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE ISI at high risk for death, with an INKEMENT score of 8-15 (n = 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Among patients with lower INCEMENT scores (n = 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56-2.56) [152]. Use of two or more in vitro active antibiotics (including colistin, tiegycline, gentamicin, carbapenems, rifampicin) was independently associated with 30-day survival in retrospective study including 111 critically ill patients with KPC-producing (K). pneumoniae infections and septic shock [123]. Lower efficacy of a single drug regimen with these drugs has been attributed to the often suboptimal dosage and the unsuitable pharmacokinetics--pharmacodynamics profile for some infection sites [174, 175, 176]. Unfortunately, none of these studies focused on specific antibiotic combinations, so information on which antimicrobials should be included in the treatment scheme cannot be derived even from higher-certainty evidence. When looking at smaller studies analysing specific drugs, polymyxin and tiegycline seemed the antimicrobials for which the addition of a companion drug seems more advisable [143, 146, 147, 151, 152, 153, 155, 157, 160, 161, 164, 167, 177, 178]. Due to the high heterogeneity of treatment included, even in smaller studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn on which companion drug should be preferred when prescribing polymyxin and tiegycline, but treatment with more than one in vitro active antibiotic might be beneficial (moderate-certainty evidence).
Carbapenem combination therapy
The inclusion of a carbapenem in the combination scheme for treating carbapenem-resistant infections has been a long-standing matter of debate. Two investigator-initiated RCT, the AIDA and OVERCOME trials, evaluated the efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-meropenem combination therapy in patients with severe infections caused by CR-GNB, mainly HAP/VAP and BSI [160, 179].

Other carbapenem-sparing treatments were evaluated in several studies. Carbapenems versus BLBLI were evaluated in one RCT [32] at high risk of bias due to small sample size and baseline differences between groups and several observational studies (moderate to high risk of bias) [28,33,35]. All studies evaluated the targeted treatment of pyelonephritis and assessed variable clinical and microbiological cure and mortality; one study assessed relapse and resistance selection [35]. None of the studies found statistically significant differences between BLBLI and carbapenems, supporting moderate-certainty evidence for BLBLI in the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.
Cephamycins and cefepime were compared with carbapenems in several retrospective cohort studies [76, 77, 78, 79]. None found statistically significant differences between groups, in very small sample sizes (the cephalosporin group ranging from 10 to 23 patients). All studies were at high risk of bias, together providing low-certainty evidence for cepamymcins and cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by 3GCephRE.
Temocillin provided for more than 50% of the time of effective antibiotic therapy duration was compared with carbapenems in a matched case--control study (144 patients) [80]. The study showed no significant difference between treatment groups in clinical cure, relapse and mortality, but despite matching there were significant differences between groups that were not adjusted for, and the confidence intervals were large, providing very low-certainty evidence for temocillin in cUTI.
Finally, two retrospective studies did not reveal significant differences in clinical cure and microbiological outcomes between carbapenems and any non-carbapenem antibiotic, with high risk of 
[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]
therapy occurred in up to 3.7%-8.1% of ceftazidime-avibactam-treated patients [101,108]. More recently in Greece, a novel plasmid-borne Vietnamese extended-spectrum b-lactamase (VEB)-25 has been described in ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant CR-K. pneumoniae strains, independent of ceftazidime-avibactam exposure [109].

The optimization of antibiotic-based interventions should focus not only on targeted PAP but also on heightening stewardship initiatives to monitor and contain the consequences of new prescription patterns, enhance surveillance protocols, improve local adherence to guidelines, and promote a multidisciplinary approach to target SSIs [114].

A large number of observational studies compared carbapenem therapy with old BLBII for the therapy of 3GCephRE BSI (20 studies, Table 3) [22-41], Empirical and targeted therapies were assessed in about half of the studies each, and all reported on mortality,
[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]
variably reporting also secondary outcomes. The largest study included 365 patients for the empirical treatment and 601 patients for targeted treatment [22], but most included a few dozen patients (Table 3). None of the studies showed a significant difference between groups, except for a small study at high risk of bias showing higher unadjusted mortality with BLBI including all Enterobacterales [41]. None of the studies were at low risk of bias; 13 were classified at moderate risk, when using an adjusted analysis with a minimal sample size allowing some adjustment and seven at high risk, mostly reporting crude associations. Hence, there is a large bulk of observational, real-life, data showing no differences in mortality and other outcomes between BLBI and carbenemens for the treatment for 3GCphRE BSI. These data are highly limited by small samples sizes that do not allow for full adjustment for indication bias, severity of infection, different bacteria and ESBL types, sources of infection and the interaction between types of bacteria and source of infection. Different susceptibility testing methods and definitions of 3GCphRE were used in different studies. The overall certainty of the evidence for the lack of advantage for carbenemens from observational studies was judged as low for low-risk BSI, and very low for high-risk BSI.
Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems and BLBI versus non-BLBI. Nine retrospective observational studies compared carbapenems with any other non-carbapenem antibiotic (carbapenem-sparing regimen); two addressed empirical treatments and all but one analysed the targeted treatment phase [30,42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. The carbapenem-sparing regimens included mainly BLBI, quinolones and aminoglycosides.

Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
Question 1.1: What is the antibiotic of choice for 3GCephRE
Recommendations

For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy (strong recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).
For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).
For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement).
For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous foafymycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).
We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement).
We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).

Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. Investigator-initiated RCT are needed addressing these gaps. Concomitantly, observational studies can include a broader and larger patient population and with improved methods to reduce bias can portray the real life and support decision-making. Antibiotic treatments addressed as the exposures in existing studies were frequently combined with other antibiotics, switched and crossed; study designs allowing a cleaner assessment of individual antibiotics or specific combinations are needed. Studies addressing targeted treatment should address the empirical antibiotic treatment and report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of the isolated bacteria to direct more individualized treatment. The ecological impact of different treatment strategies should be evaluated.
Evidence is lacking on the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics (e.g. pivmecilliam, fosfomycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), for initial treatment of clinically stable patients with UTI or as oral follow up, compared with continued definitive intravenous therapy. Furthermore, more studies are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens (dose, frequency, intermittent or prolonged administration) and treatment durations especially when using b-lactam antibiotics.

For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.

Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype. The main comparison is between the older BLBII (amoxicillin- clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapemens and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.
Bloodstream infections
BLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae[16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI -o to 14.5%).

In the retrospective INCEMENT cohort such combination therapy was associated with lower 30-day mortality among patients with CRE ISI at high risk for death, with an INKEMENT score of 8-15 (n = 166; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.91). Among patients with lower INCEMENT scores (n = 177), combination therapy was not associated with survival (adjusted OR 1.21) 95% CI 0.56-2.56) [152].

For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock, etapenem instead of impienem or meropenem may be used (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence).
For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to 3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship, we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or quinolones (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence/good practice statement). It may be good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe complicated UTI (cUTI) (good practice statement).
For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro, for short durations of therapy (conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of evidence), or intravenous foafymycin (strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).
We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement).
We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).

Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. Investigator-initiated RCT are needed addressing these gaps. Concomitantly, observational studies can include a broader and larger patient population and with improved methods to reduce bias can portray the real life and support decision-making. Antibiotic treatments addressed as the exposures in existing studies were frequently combined with other antibiotics, switched and crossed; study designs allowing a cleaner assessment of individual antibiotics or specific combinations are needed. Studies addressing targeted treatment should address the empirical antibiotic treatment and report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of the isolated bacteria to direct more individualized treatment. The ecological impact of different treatment strategies should be evaluated.
Evidence is lacking on the efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics (e.g. pivmecilliam, fosfomycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), for initial treatment of clinically stable patients with UTI or as oral follow up, compared with continued definitive intravenous therapy. Furthermore, more studies are needed to establish optimal dosing regimens (dose, frequency, intermittent or prolonged administration) and treatment durations especially when using b-lactam antibiotics.

For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.

Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was the most commonly reported resistance mechanism, mostly without specifying the type of b-lactamases conferring the ESBL phenotype. The main comparison is between the older BLBII (amoxicillin- clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam) and carbapemens and discusses the conflict between the MERINO RCT [16] and the observational data [17,18]. An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.
Bloodstream infections
BLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae[16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI -o to 14.5%).

Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253]. The guidance format, intended to address rapidly evolving topics, does not include a systematic review of the literature and does not use the formal GRADE process to appraise the evidence. Recommendations were developed by six infectious diseases specialists and were made also where evidence was lacking, thus addressing more specific scenarios. The paucity of the evidence on the effects of the new BIBLI against MDR-GNB, mainly CR-GNB, as well as antibiotic stewardship considerations (including also settings in which the new BIBLI are not available) underly the main differences between our guidelines and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance. Our guidelines stress the situations where alternatives to carbapenems and the new BIBLI are possible, stratifying patients by sepsis severity and hence the urgency of sepsis control: piperacillin-tazolbactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate are considered in the treatment of 3GcephRE in our guidelines; aminoglycosides are considered for cUTI; and the scenarios in which sparing of the new BIBLI is possible are presented. Combination therapies are less strongly recommended in our guidelines that address the certainty of the evidence with respect to clinical outcomes.
Considering costs and equity
Antibiotics, both old and new, are not equally available worldwide. In low-resource settings, costs of the new antibiotics might prohibit their use; and even in other settings costs of the new antibiotics enter the consideration for use. Antibiotics critical to management of the priority pathogens should be defined and more efforts should be implemented to ensure the universal availability of these antibiotics. Differential costs of the new antibiotics for different socio-economic settings will allow better equity of patient management.
Research needs
Recommendations for further research were not developed formally and were not graded. Most recommendations in the guideline are based on very-low-certainty evidence or no evidence. Only RCT provided high-certainty evidence. RCT are needed that assess patients with infections due to 3GCephRE and CR-GNB; most antibiotic approval trials of the new antibiotics were syndrome-based and included only a few patients with the MDR bacteria for which these antibiotics were developed.

    How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized?
    [/INST]
    

* The answer obtained with context and additional prompt is :

The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is organized by clinical syndrome: Bloodstream infections (BSI), Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), Pneumonia, and Intra-abdominal Infections (IAI). The studies referred to in the text are described in Table  3. For BSI, the main comparison is between BLBLI and carbapenems, with the MERINO trial being the most well-known study. The evidence is also influenced by stewardship considerations, such as the association between carbapenem use and CRE. Local guidelines should address the empirical treatment phase and consider alternatives to carbapenems and the new BLBLI, stratifying patients by sepsis severity. Costs and equity considerations are also important, as antibiotics are not equally available worldwide and differential costs for different socio-

* REFERENCE ANSWER :
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is organized by clinical syndrome, including bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, and intra-abdominal infection (IAI).

* 8 chunks retrieved for the query : "How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized?"

- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.5237299203872681):
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown targeted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabilized, using old b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BBLII), quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice (good practice statement).
We do not recommend tigecyline for infections caused by 3GCephRE (strong recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.480491042137146):
Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBII are reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and therefore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship considerations (good practice statement).
We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, flomoxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections (conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty of evidence).

- CHUNK 3 (similarity : 0.47687190771102905):
The most important concern the use of carbapenems for infections caused by 3GcephRE. In different epidemiological settings of cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales and prevalence of CR-GNB, the implications of adopting a sweeping practice of carbapenems for all 3GcephRE are variable. We addressed this recommendation by sepsis severity and source of infection, allowing the option of carbapenem-sparing therapy for non-severe infections and low-risk sources of infection, and addressing stepdown therapy.

- CHUNK 4 (similarity : 0.46423113346099854):
Although we intended by protocol to obtain data by source of infection, this was possible only for 3GCephRE and as a result infection source-specific guidance is mostly lacking. Investigator-initiated RCT are needed addressing these gaps. Concomitantly, observational studies can include a broader and larger patient population and with improved methods to reduce bias can portray the real life and support decision-making. Antibiotic treatments addressed as the exposures in existing studies were frequently combined with other antibiotics, switched and crossed; study designs allowing a cleaner assessment of individual antibiotics or specific combinations are needed.

- CHUNK 5 (similarity : 0.4628366231918335):
A difficult antibiotic stewardship balance exists between achieving appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with infections due to CR-GNB and the need to conserve last resort therapies for these bacteria. The empirical treatment phase is relevant to a much larger population than targeted treatment. Local guidelines, guided by the local epidemiology, should address the empirical treatment phase.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently published guidance documents on the treatment of 3GcephRE, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa and CRAB [252,253].

- CHUNK 6 (similarity : 0.4583503305912018):
As a result, there is no direct evidence on targeted quinolone therapy for 3GcephRE BSI, but favourable effects were observed in studies assessing Gram-negative bacteriaemia in general, where a proportion of patients is expected to have had 3GcephRE BSI [68].
Aminoglycosides were examined specifically in a single study [69] and as part of a general comparator group in two studies [42,70].

- CHUNK 7 (similarity : 0.3979874551296234):
For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin- clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insufficient evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephRE infections at the time of writing and therefore no recommendation can be issued.

Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with BSI and urinary source of infection. In many studies there was a lack of information on the bacterial species and mechanisms of resistance.

- CHUNK 8 (similarity : 0.3831377625465393):
An underlying stewardship consideration for this comparison was the association between carbapenem use and CRE [19]. Data on new antibiotics are sparse because most new antibiotic approval RCT were syndrome-based and the subgroups of patients with 3GCephRE infections were small. For 3GCephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text are described in Table 3.

[INST] How is the evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE organized? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

The evidence on the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) is organized through various sources, including peer-reviewed scientific journals, clinical guidelines, and meta-analyses. Here are some ways the evidence is typically organized:

1. Peer-reviewed scientific journals: Research studies on the treatment of infections caused by 3GCs are published in scientific journals. These studies can be categorized based on their study design, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, or systematic reviews. RCTs are considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments, while observational studies can provide valuable real-world data on how a treatment is used in clinical practice.
2. Clinical guidelines: Clinical guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

The evidence on the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant bacteria (3GCRE) is organized through numerous studies, meta-analyses, and guidelines from reputable medical organizations and journals. These sources provide evidence on the effectiveness and safety of various treatment options, including specific antibiotics and combinations, for different types of 3GCRE infections. It is important to note that the evidence is constantly evolving as new research emerges, and healthcare professionals should stay updated on the latest guidelines and recommendations. Some commonly referenced sources include the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and major medical journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet.

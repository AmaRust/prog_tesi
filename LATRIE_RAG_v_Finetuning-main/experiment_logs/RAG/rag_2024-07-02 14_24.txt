- CHUNK 1 (similarity : 0.5279226303100586):
For
3GcephRE, only PICO 1 on the choice of antibiotic treatment was
addressed.
The evidence on treatment of infections caused by 3GCephRE is
provided by clinical syndrome: BSI, UTI, pneumonia and intra-
abdominal infection (IAI). All studies referred to in the text aredescribed in Table 3 .
Bloodstream infections
BLBLI versus carbapenems. The MERINO trial compared piper-
acillin-tazobactam with meropenem among patients with BSI
caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli
andK. pneumoniae [16]. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality
and the study did not prove the non-inferiority of piperacillin-
tazobactam, with 30-day mortality rates of 23/187 (12.3%) with
piperacillin-tazobactam versus 7/191 (3.7%) with meropenem (risk
difference (RD) 8.6%, one-sided 97.5% CI e∞to 14.5%).

- CHUNK 2 (similarity : 0.5138775110244751):
/C15Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are
reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and there-
fore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for
infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship
considerations ( good practice statement ).
/C15We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, ﬂo-
moxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections
(conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty
of evidence ).
/C15For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-
clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insuf ﬁcient
evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephREinfections at the time of writing and therefore no recommen-
dation can be issued.
Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from
observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with
BSI and urinary source of infection.

* The prompt we are going to use without additional prompt and context is :

[INST] What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

For patients with bacteremia (BSI, or bloodstream infection) and severe infection caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Enterobacterales (3GCephalosporin-resistant, 3GCephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy depends on the susceptibility profile of the isolate and local guidelines.

Here are some common options:

1. Carbapenems: Carbapenems, such as meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem, are often used as first-line agents for treating infections caused by 3GCephrE due to their broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases

What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? 
[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

For patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) and severe infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3GCephrasporin-resistant, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy is usually a carbapenem antibiotic. Examples include meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem. These antibiotics can effectively cover against 3GCephrE producing bacteria and have good penetration into the bacterial cell wall. However, it's essential to consider local resistance patterns and individual patient factors before making a definitive treatment decision. Always consult with an infectious disease specialist for the most accurate information.

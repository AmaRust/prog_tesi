1. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant EnterobacteralesQuestion 1.1: What is the antibiotic of choice for 3GCephRERecommendations
/C15For patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE, we
recommend a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as tar-
geted therapy ( strong recommendation for use, moderate
certainty of evidence ).
/C15For patients with BSI due to 3GCephRE without septic shock,
ertapenem instead of imipenem or meropenem may be used
(conditional recommendation for use, moderate certainty of
evidence ).
/C15For patients with low-risk, non-severe infections due to
3GCephRE, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship,
we suggest piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
or quinolones ( conditional recommendation for use, moder-
ate certainty of evidence/good practice statement ). It may be
good practice to consider cotrimoxazole for non-severe
complicated UTI (cUTI) ( good practice statement ).
/C15For cUTI in patients without septic shock, we conditionally
recommend aminoglycosides when active in vitro , for short
durations of therapy ( conditional recommendation for use,
moderate certainty of evidence ), or intravenous fosfomycin
(strong recommendation for use, high certainty of evidence )
/C15Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, stepdown tar-
geted therapy following carbapenems once patients are stabi-
lized, using old
b-lactam/ b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI),
quinolones, cotrimoxazole or other antibiotics based on the
susceptibility pattern of the isolate, is good clinical practice
(good practice statement ).
/C15We do not recommend tigecycline for infections caused by
3GCephRE ( strong recommendation against use, very low
certainty of evidence ).
/C15Among all patients with 3GCephRE infections, the new BLBLI are
reserve antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria and there-
fore, we consider it good clinical practice to avoid their use for
infections caused by 3GCephRE, due to antibiotic stewardship
considerations ( good practice statement ).
/C15We suggest that cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefmetazole, ﬂo-
moxef) and cefepime not be used for 3GCephRE infections
(conditional recommendation against use, very low certainty
of evidence ).
/C15For cefoperazone-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-
clavulanic acid, temocillin and mecillinam there is insuf ﬁcient
evidence for the management of patients with 3GCephREinfections at the time of writing and therefore no recommen-
dation can be issued.
Review of the evidence
The data available on 3GCephRE are derived mainly from
observational studies in the hospital setting including patients with
BSI and urinary source of infection.

* The prompt we are going to use without additional prompt and context is :

[INST] What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? [/INST]

* The answer obtained without additional prompt and context is :

For patients with bacteremia (BSI, or bloodstream infection) and severe infection caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing Klebsiella pneumoniae or other Enterobacterales (3GCephalosporin-resistant, 3GCephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy depends on the susceptibility profile of the isolate and local guidelines.

Here are some common options:

1. Carbapenems: Carbapenems, such as meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem, are often used as first-line agents for treating infections caused by 3GCephrE due to their broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases

What is the recommended targeted therapy for patients with BSI and severe infection due to 3GCephRE? 
[/INST]

* The answer obtained with additional prompt but without context is :

For patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) and severe infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3GCephrasporin-resistant, or 3GCephrE), the recommended targeted therapy is usually a carbapenem antibiotic. Examples include meropenem, imipenem, or doripenem. These antibiotics can effectively cover against 3GCephrE producing bacteria and have good penetration into the bacterial cell wall. However, it's essential to consider local resistance patterns and individual patient factors before making a definitive treatment decision. Always consult with an infectious disease specialist for the most accurate information.
